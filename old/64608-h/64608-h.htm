<p>Puget Sound lies in its emerald setting
like a great blue sapphire, which at sunset,
draws to its breast all the marvelous
and splendid coloring of the fire-opal.
Around it, shining through their rose-colored
mists like pearls upon the soft blue
or green of the sky, are linked the great
snow-mountains, so beautiful and so dear,
that those who love this land with a proud
and passionate love, have come to think of
it, fondly and poetically, as “the land of
the snow-pearls.”</p>

<h3>THE FLOWER THAT GREW IN THE SAND</h3>

<p>Demaris opened the gate and walked up the
narrow path. There was a low hedge of pink and
purple candytuft on each side. Inside the hedges
were little beds of homely flowers in the shapes
of hearts, diamonds and Maltese crosses.</p>

<p>Mrs. Eaton was stooping over a rosebush, but
she arose when she heard the click of the gate.
She stood looking at Demaris, with her arms
hanging stiffly at her sides.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she said, with a grim smile; “you, is
it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the girl, blushing and looking
embarrassed. “Ain’t it a nice evenin’?”</p>

<p>“It is that; awful nice. I’m tyin’ up my rosebushes.
Won’t you come in an’ set down a
while?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my, no!” said Demaris. Her eyes went
wistfully to the pink rosebush. “I can’t stay.”</p>

<p>“Come fer kindlin’ wood?”</p>

<p>“No.” She laughed a little at the worn-out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
joke. “I come to see ’f you had two or three
pink roses to spare.”</p>

<p>“Why, to be sure, a dozen if you want. Just
come an’ help yourself. My hands ain’t fit to
tech ’em after diggin’ so.”</p>

<p>She stood watching the girl while she carefully
selected some half-open roses. There was a look
of good-natured curiosity on her face.</p>

<p>“Anything goin’ on at the church to-night?”</p>

<p>“No; at least not that I know of.”</p>

<p>“It must be a party then.”</p>

<p>“No—not a party, either.” She laughed
merrily. Her face was hidden as she bent over
the roses, but her ears were pink under the heavy
brown hair that fell, curling, over them.</p>

<p>“Well, then, somebody’s comin’ to see you.”</p>

<p>“No; I’ll have to tell you.” She lifted a glad,
shy face. “I’m goin’ on the moonlight excursion.”</p>

<p>“Oh, now! Sure? Well, I’m reel glad.”</p>

<p>“So’m I. I never wanted to go anywheres so
much in my life. I’ve been ’most holdin’ my
breath for fear ma’d get sick.”</p>

<p>“How is your ma?”</p>

<p>“Well, she ain’t very well; she never is, you
know.”</p>

<p>“What ails her?”</p>

<p>“I do’ know,” said Demaris, slowly. “We’ll
get home by midnight. So ’f she has a spell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
come on, pa can set up with her till I get home,
and then I can till mornin’.”</p>

<p>“Should think you’d be all wore out a-settin’
up two or three nights a week that way.”</p>

<p>Demaris sighed. The radiance had gone out
of her face and a look of care was upon it.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, after a moment, “I’ll have a
good time to-night, anyhow. We’re goin’ to have
the band along. They’re gettin’ so’s they play
reel well. They play ‘Annie Laurie’ an’ ‘Rocked
’n the Cradle o’ the Deep,’ now.”</p>

<p>The gate clicked. A child came running up
the path.</p>

<p>“Oh, sister, sister! Come home quick!”</p>

<p>“What for?” said Demaris. There was a look
of dread on her face.</p>

<p>“Ma’s goin’ right into a spell. She wants you
quick. She thinks she’s took worse ’n usual.”</p>

<p>There was a second’s hesitation. The girl’s
face whitened. Her lips trembled.</p>

<p>“I guess I won’t want the roses after gettin’
’em,” she said. “I’m just as much obliged,
though, Mis’ Eaton.”</p>

<p>She followed the child to the gate.</p>

<p>“Well, if that don’t beat all!” ejaculated Mrs.
Eaton, looking after her with genuine sympathy.
“It just seems as if she had a spell to order ev’ry
time that girl wants to go anywheres. It’s nothin’
but hysterics, anyway. I’d like to doctor her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
for a while. I’d souze a bucket o’ cold water
over her! I reckon that ’u’d fetch her to ’n a
hurry.”</p>

<p>She laughed with a kind of stern mirth and resumed
her work.</p>

<p>Demaris hurried home. The child ran at her
side. Once she took her hand and gave her an
upward look of sympathy.</p>

<p>She passed through the kitchen, laying her
roses on the table. Then she went into her
mother’s room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ferguson lay on a couch. A white cloth
was banded around her head, coming well down
over one eye. She was moaning bitterly.</p>

<p>Demaris looked at her without speaking.</p>

<p>“Where on earth you been?” She gave the
girl a look of fierce reproach. “A body might
die, fer all the help you’d be to ’em. Here I’ve
been a-feelin’ a spell a-comin’ on all day, an’ yet
you go a-gaddin’ ’round to the neighbors, leavin’
me to get along the best way I know how. I
believe this is my last spell. I’ve got that awful
pain over my right eye ag’in, till I’m nearly
crazy. My liver’s all out o’ order.”</p>

<p>Demaris was silent. When one has heard the
cry of “wolf” a hundred times, one is inclined to
be incredulous. Her apathetic look angered her
mother.</p>

<p>“What makes you stand there a-starin’ like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
dunce? Can’t you help a body? Get the camfire
bottle an’ the tincture lobelia an’ the box o’ goose
grease! You know’s well’s me what I need when
I git a spell. I’m so nervous I feel’s if I c’u’d
fly. I got a horrible feelin’ that this’ll be my last
spell—an’ yet you stand there a-starin’ ’s if you
didn’t care a particle!”</p>

<p>Demaris moved about the room stiffly, as if
every muscle in her body were in rebellion. She
took from a closet filled with drugs the big camphor
bottle with its cutglass stopper, the little
bottle labeled “tinc. lobelia,” and the box of
goose grease.</p>

<p>She placed a chair at the side of the couch
to hold the bottle. “Oh, take that old split-bottom
cheer away!” exclaimed her mother.
“Everything upsets on it so! Get one from the
kitchen—the one that’s got cherries painted on
the back of it. What makes you ac’ so? You
know what cheer I want. You’d tantalize the
soul out of a saint!”</p>

<p>The chair was brought. The bottles were placed
upon it. Demaris stood waiting.</p>

<p>“Now rub my head with the camfire, or I’ll go
ravin’ crazy. I can’t think where ’t comes from!”</p>

<p>The child stood twitching her thin fingers
around a chair. She watched her mother in a
matter-of-course way. Demaris leaned over the
couch in an uncomfortable position and commenced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
the slow, gentle massage that must continue all
night. She did not lift her eyes. They were full
of tears.</p>

<p>For a long time there was silence in the room.
Mrs. Ferguson lay with closed eyes. Her face
wore a look of mingled injury and reproach.</p>

<p>“Nellie,” said Demaris, after a while, “could
you make a fire in the kitchen stove? Or would
you rather try to do this while I build it?”</p>

<p>“Hunh-unh,” said the child, shaking her head
with emphasis. “I’d ruther build fires any
time.”</p>

<p>“All right. Put two dippers o’ water ’n the
tea-kettle. Be sure you get your dampers right.
An’ I guess you might wash some potatoes an’
put ’em in to bake. They’ll be done by time pa
comes, an’ he can stay with ma while I warm up
the rest o’ the things. Ma, what could you eat?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I do’ know”—in a slightly mollified tone.
“A piece o’ toast, mebbe—’f you don’t get it too
all-fired hard.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll try not.”</p>

<p>Nellie went out, and there was silence in the
room. The wind came in through the open window,
shaking little ripples of perfume into the
room. The sun was setting and a broad band of
reddish gold sunk down the wall.</p>

<p>Demaris watched it sinking lower, and thought
how slowly the sun was settling behind the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
straight pines on the crests of the blue mountains.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Mrs. Ferguson, “what a wretched
creature I am! Just a-sufferin’ day an’ night,
year in an’ year out, an’ a burden on them that
I’ve slaved fer all my life. Many’s the night I’ve
walked with you ’n my arms till mornin’, Demaris,
an’ never knowed what it was to git sleepy or tired.
An’ now you git mad the minute I go into a spell.”</p>

<p>Demaris stood upright with a tortured look.</p>

<p>“Oh, ma,” she exclaimed. Her voice was harsh
with pain. “I ain’t mad. Don’t think I’m mad.
I can’t cry out o’ pity ev’ry time you have a
spell, or I’d be cryin’ all the time. An’ besides,
to-night I’m so—disappointed.”</p>

<p>“What you disappointed about?”</p>

<p>“Why, you know.” Her lips trembled. “The
excursion.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ferguson opened her eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’d clean fergot that.”</p>

<p>She looked as if she were thinking she would
really have postponed the spell, if she had remembered.
“That’s too bad, Demaris. That’s
always the way.” She began to cry helplessly.
“I’m always in the way. Always mis’rable myself,
an’ always makin’ somebody else mis’rable.
I don’t see what I was born fer.”</p>

<p>“Never you mind.” Demaris leaned over suddenly
and put her arms around her mother.
“Don’t you think I’m mad. I’m just disappointed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
Now don’t cry. You’ll go and make
yourself worse. An’ there comes pa; I hear him
cleanin’ his boots on the scraper.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ferguson stumbled as he came up the steps
to the kitchen. He was very tired. He was not
more than fifty, but his thin frame had a pitiable
stoop. The look of one who has struggled long
and failed was on his brown and wrinkled face.
His hair and beard were prematurely gray. His
dim blue eyes had a hopeless expression that was
almost hidden by a deeper one of patience. He
wore a coarse flannel shirt, moist with perspiration,
and faded blue overalls. His boots were
wrinkled and hard; the soil of the fields clung
to them. “Sick ag’in, ma?” he said.</p>

<p>“Sick ag’in! Mis’rable creature that I am!
I’ve got that awful pain over my right eye ag’in.
I can’t think where it comes from. I’m nearly
crazy with it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you’ll feel a little better after you
git some tea. I’ll go an’ wash, an’ then rub your
head, while Demaris gits a bite to eat. I’ve
plowed ever since sun-up, an’ I’m tired an’ hungry.”</p>

<p>He returned in a few minutes, and took Demaris’s
place. He sighed deeply, but silently, as
he sat down.</p>

<p>Demaris set the table and spread upon it the
simple meal which she had prepared. “I’ll stay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
with ma while you an’ pa eat,” said Nellie, with
a sudden burst of unselfishness.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Demaris, wearily.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferguson sat down at the table and leaned
his head on his hand. “I’m too tired to eat,” he
said; “hungry’s I am.” He looked at the untempting
meal of cold boiled meat, baked potatoes
and apple sauce.</p>

<p>Demaris did not lift her eyes as she sat down.
She felt that she ought to say something cheerful,
but her heart was too full of her own disappointment.
She despised her selfishness even while
yielding to it.</p>

<p>“It does beat all about your ma,” said her
father. “I can’t see where she gits that pain
from. It ain’t nothin’ danger’s or it ’u’d a-killed
her long ago. It almost seems ’s if she jests gits
tired o’ bein’ well, an’ begins to git scared fer
fear that pain’s a-comin’ on—an’ then it comes
right on. I’ve heard her say lots o’ times that
she’d been well a whole week now, but that she
w’u’dn’t brag or that pain ’u’d come on—an’
inside of an hour it ’ud up an’ come on. It’s
awful discouragin’.”</p>

<p>“I wish I was dead!” said Demaris.</p>

<p>Her father did not speak. His silence reproached
her more than any words could have
done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span></p>

<p>When she went into the bedroom again she
found her mother crying childishly.</p>

<p>“Demaris, did I hear you say you wished you
was dead?”</p>

<p>“I guess so. I said it.”</p>

<p>“Well, God Almighty knows I wish I was!
You don’t stop to think what ’u’d become o’ me
’f it wa’n’t fer you. Your pa c’u’dn’t hire anybody,
an’ he’s gittin’ too old to set up o’ nights
after workin’ hard all day. You’d like to see ’t
all come on your little sister, I reckon.”</p>

<p>Demaris thought of those slim, weak wrists,
and shivered. Her mother commenced to sob—and
that aggravated the pain.</p>

<p>Demaris stooped and put her arms around her
and kissed her.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry I said it,” she whispered. “I didn’t
mean it. I’m just tired an’ cross. You know I
didn’t mean it.”</p>

<p>Her father came in heavily.</p>

<p>“Demaris,” he said, “Frank Vickers is comin’
’round to the front door. I’ll take keer o’ your
ma while you go in an’ see him.”</p>

<p>It was a radiant-faced young fellow that walked
into Demaris’s little parlor. He took her hand
with a tenderness that brought the color beating
into her cheeks.</p>

<p>“What?” he said. “An’ you ain’t ready?
Why, the boat leaves in an hour, an’ it’s a good,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
long walk to the wharf. You’ll have to hurry
up, Demaris.”</p>

<p>“I can’t go.”</p>

<p>“You can’t go? Why can’t you?”</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes bravely. Then tears swelled
into them very slowly until they were full. Not
one fell. She looked at him through them. He
felt her hand trembling against the palm of his
own.</p>

<p>“Why can’t you, Demaris?”</p>

<p>“My mother’s sick—just hear her moanin’ clear
in here.”</p>

<p>Young Vickers’s face was a study.</p>

<p>“Why, she was sick last time I wanted to take
you som’ers—to a dance, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes—I know.”</p>

<p>“An’ time before that, when I wanted you to
go to a church sociable up’n String Town.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Why, she must be sick near onto all the time,
accordin’ to that.”</p>

<p>“She is—pretty near.” She withdrew her
hand. There was a stiff-looking lounge in one
corner of the room. It was covered with Brussels
carpet, and had an uncomfortable back, but it
was dear to Demaris’s heart. She had gathered
and sold strawberries two whole summers to pay
for it. She sat down on it now and laid her
hands together on her knees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span></p>

<p>The young man followed and sat down beside
her.</p>

<p>“Why, my dear,” he said, very quietly, “you
can’t stand this sort of thing—it’s wearin’ you
out. You never did look light an’ happy like
other girls o’ your age; an’ lately you’re gettin’
a real pinched look. I feel as if ’t was time for
me to interfere.” He took her hand again.</p>

<p>It was dim twilight in the room now. Demaris
turned her head aside. The tears brimmed
over and fell fast and silently.</p>

<p>“Interferin’ won’t do no good,” she said, resolutely.
“There’s just two things about it. My
mother’s sick all the time, an’ I have to wait on
her. There’s nobody else to do it.”</p>

<p>“Well, as long ’s you stay at home it’ll all come
on you. You ain’t able to carry sech a load.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to.”</p>

<p>“Demaris, you’ll just have to leave.”</p>

<p>“What!” said the girl. She turned to look at
him in a startled way. “Leave home? I couldn’t
think of doin’ that.”</p>

<p>He leaned toward her and put his arm around
her, trembling strongly. “Not even to come to
my home, Demaris? I want you, dear; an’ I
won’t let you kill yourself workin’, either. I ain’t
rich, but I’m well enough off to give you a comfortable
home an’ some one to do your work for
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span></p>

<p>There was a deep silence. Each felt the full
beating of the other’s heart. There was a rosebush
under the window, an old-fashioned one.
Its blooms were not beautiful, but they were very
sweet. It had flung a slim, white spray of them
into the room. Demaris never smelled their fragrance
afterward without a keen, exquisite thrill
of passion, as brief as it was delicious.</p>

<p>“I can’t, Frank.” Her tone was low and uncertain.
“I can’t leave my mother. She’s sick
an’ gettin’ old. I can’t.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Demaris! That’s rank foolishness!”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess it’s the right kind of foolishness.”
She drew away and sat looking at him.
Her hands were pressed together in her lap.</p>

<p>“Why, it ain’t expected that a girl ’ad ought
to stay an’ take care o’ her mother forever, is it?
It ain’t expected that she ought to turn herself
into a hospital nurse, is it?”</p>

<p>Her face grew stern.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk that way, Frank. That ain’t respectful
to my mother. She’s had a hard life an’
so’s my father. You know I want to come, but
I can’t. It’s my place to stay an’ take care o’
her. I’m goin’ to do it—hard ’s it is. My leavin’
’em ’u’d just take the heart out of both of ’em.
An’ there’s Nellie, too.”</p>

<p>“Demaris—” he spoke slowly; his face was
pale—“I’m goin’ to say somethin’ to you I never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
thought I’d say to any girl alive. But the fact
is, I didn’t know till right now how much I think
o’ you. You marry me, an’ we’ll all live together?”</p>

<p>Her face softened. She leaned a little toward
him with uncontrollable tenderness. But as he
made a quick movement, she drew back.</p>

<p>“No, Frank. I can’t—I can’t! It won’t do.
Such things is what breaks women’s hearts!”</p>

<p>“What things, dear?”</p>

<p>“Folks livin’ together that way. There’s no
good ever comes of it. I’d have to set up with
mother just the same, an’ you’d be worryin’ all
the time for fear it ’u’d make me sick, an’ you’d
be wantin’ to set up with ’er yourself.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” he said, stoutly. “I’d expect to.
That’s what I mean. I’d take some o’ your load
off o’ you.”</p>

<p>Demaris smiled mournfully. “You don’t know
what it is, Frank. It’s all very well to talk about
it, but when it comes to doin’ it you’d be tired
out ’n a month. You’d wish you hadn’t married
me—an’ that ’u’d kill me!”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t. Oh, Demaris, just you try me.
I’ll be good to all your folks—just as good’s can
be, dear. I swear it.”</p>

<p>She leaned toward him again with a sob. He
took her in his arms. He felt the delicious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
warmth of her body. Their lips trembled together.</p>

<p>After a while she drew away slowly and looked
at him earnestly in the faint light.</p>

<p>“If I thought you wouldn’t change,” she faltered.
“I know you mean it now, but oh—”</p>

<p>“Sister,” called a thin, troubled voice from the
hall; “can’t you come here just a minute?”</p>

<p>Demaris went at once, closing the door behind
her.</p>

<p>The child threw her slim arms around her
sister’s waist, sobbing.</p>

<p>“Oh, sister, I forgot to get the kindlin’ wood,
an’ now it’s so dark down cellar. I’m afraid.
Can’t you come with me?”</p>

<p>“Wait a few minutes, dear, an’ I will. Frank
won’t stay long to-night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, won’t he? I’m so glad.” Her voice
sunk to a whisper. “I hate to have him here,
sister. He takes you away from us so much, an’
ev’rything goes wrong when you ain’t here. Ma’s
offul bad to-night, an’ pa looks so tired! Don’t
let him stay long, sister. He don’t need you as
bad ’s we do.”</p>

<p>She tiptoed into the kitchen. Demaris stood
still in the hall. The moon was coming, large
and silver, over the hill. Its soft light brought
her slender figure out of the dark, and set a halo
above her head bending on its fair neck, like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
flower on its stem. Her lips moved, but the
prayer remained voiceless in her heart.</p>

<p>A moan came from her mother’s room.</p>

<p>“Oh, paw, you hurt my head! Your hand’s
terrable rough! Is that girl goin’ to stay in there
forever?”</p>

<p>Demaris lifted her head and walked steadily
into the poor little parlor. “I’ll have to ask you
to go now, Frank; my mother needs me.”</p>

<p>“Well, dear.” He reached his strong young
arms to her. She stood back, moving her head
from side to side.</p>

<p>“No, Frank. I can’t marry you, now or ever.
My mother comes first.”</p>

<p>“But you ain’t taken time to make up your
mind, Demaris. I’ll wait fer ’n answer.”</p>

<p>“It’s no use. I made up my mind out ’n the
hall. You might as well go. When I make up
my mind it’s no use in tryin’ to get me to change
it. I hadn’t made it up before.”</p>

<p>He went to her and took her hands.</p>

<p>“Demaris,” he said, and all his heart-break was
in his voice, “do you mean it? Oh, my dear,
I’ll go if you send me; but I’ll never come back
again; never.”</p>

<p>She hesitated but a second. Then she said
very gently, without emotion—“Yes, go. You’ve
been good to me; but it’s all over. Good-bye.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span></p>

<p>He dropped her hands without a word, and
went.</p>

<p>She did not look after him, or listen to his footsteps.
She went to the cellar with Nellie, to get
the kindling wood, which she arranged in the
stove, ready for the match in the morning.</p>

<p>Then she went into her mother’s room. She
looked pale in the flickering light of the candle.</p>

<p>“I’ll take care of ma, now, pa,” she said.
“You get to bed an’ rest. I know you’re all
tired out—plowin’ ever since sun-up! An’ don’t
you get up till I call you. I ain’t a bit sleepy.
I couldn’t sleep if I went to bed.”</p>

<p>She moistened her fingers with camphor and
commenced bathing her mother’s brow.</p>

<h3>ESTHER’S “FOURTH”</h3>

<p>It was the fourth day of July, and the fourth
hour of the day. Long, beryl ribbons of color
were streaming through the lovely Grand Ronde
valley when the little girl awoke—so suddenly
and so completely that it seemed as if she had not
been asleep at all.</p>

<p>“Sister!” she cried in a thin, eager voice.
“Ain’t it time to get up? It’s just struck four.”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” said the older girl drowsily.
“There’s lots o’ time, Pet.”</p>

<p>She put one arm under the child affectionately
and fell asleep again. The little girl lay motionless,
waiting. There was a large cherry tree outside,
close to the tiny window above her bed, and
she could hear the soft turning of the leaves, one
against the other, and the fluttering of the robins
that were already stealing the cherries. Innocent
thieves that they were, they continually
betrayed themselves by their shrill cries of
triumph.</p>

<p>Not far from the tiny log-cabin the river went
singing by on its way through the green valley;
hearing it, Esther thought of the soft glooms
under the noble balm trees, where the grouse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
drummed and butterflies drifted in long level
flight. Esther always breathed softly while she
watched the butterflies—she had a kind of reverence
for them—and she thought there could be
nothing sweeter, even in heaven, than the scents
that the wind shook out of the balms.</p>

<p>She lay patiently waiting with wide eyes until
the round clock in the kitchen told her that another
hour had gone by. “Sister,” she said then,
“oh, it must be time to get up! I just <i>can’t</i>
wait any longer.”</p>

<p>The older girl, with a sleepy but sympathetic
smile, slipped out of bed and commenced dressing.
The child sprang after her. “Sister,” she
cried, running to the splint-bottomed chair on
which lay the cheap but exquisitely white undergarments.
“I can’t hardly wait. Ain’t it good
of Mr. Hoover to take me to town? Oh, I feel
as if I had hearts all over me, an’ every one of
’em beating so!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be so excited, Pet.” The older sister
smiled gently at the child. “Things never are
quite as nice as you expect them to be,” she
added, with that wisdom that comes so soon to
starved country hearts.</p>

<p>“Well, this can’t help bein’ nice,” said the
child, with a beautiful faith. She sat on the strip
of rag carpeting that partially covered the rough
floor, and drew on her stockings and her copper-toed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
shoes. “Oh, sister, my fingers shake so I can’t
get the strings through the eyelets! Do you
think Mr. Hoover might oversleep hisself? It
can’t help bein’ nice—nicer’n I expect. Of
course,” she added, with a momentary regret,
“I wish I had some other dress besides that buff
calico, but I ain’t, an’ so—it’s reel pretty, anyways,
sister, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Pet,” said the girl gently. There was
a bitter pity for the child in her heart.</p>

<p>“To think o’ ridin’ in the Libraty Car!” continued
Esther, struggling with the shoe strings.
“Course they’ll let me, Paw knows the store-keeper,
and Mr. Hoover kin tell ’em who I am.
An’ the horses, an’ the ribbons, an’ the music—an’
all the little girls my age! Sister, it’s awful
never to have any little girls to play with! I
guess maw don’t know how I’ve wanted ’em,
or she’d of took me to town sometimes. I
ain’t never been anywheres—except to Mis’ Bunnels’s
fun’ral, when the minister prayed so long,”
she added, with a pious after-thought.</p>

<p>It was a happy child that was lifted to the
back of the most trustworthy of the plow-horses
to be escorted to the celebration by “Mr. Hoover,”
the hired man. The face under the cheap straw
hat, with its wreath of pink and green artificial
flowers, was almost pathetically radiant. To that
poor little heart so hungry for pleasure, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
could be no bliss so supreme as a ride in the village
“Libraty Car”—to be one of the states, preferably
“Oregon!” To hear the music and hold a
flag, and sit close to little girls of her own age who
would smile kindly at her and, perhaps, even ask
her name shyly, and take her home with them to
see their dolls.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she cried, grasping the reins in her thin
hands, “I’m all of a tremble! Just like maw on
wash days! Only I ain’t tired—I’m just glad.”</p>

<p>There were shifting groups of children in front
of the school house. Everything—even the white
houses with their green blinds and neat door-yards—seemed
strange and over-powering to
Esther. The buoyancy with which she had surveyed
the world from the back of a tall horse
gave way to sudden timidity and self-consciousness.</p>

<p>Mr. Hoover put her down in the midst of the
children. “There, now,” he said cheerfully, “play
around with the little girls like a nice body while
I put up the horses.”</p>

<p>A terrible loneliness came upon Esther as she
watched him leading away the horses. All those
merry children chattering and shouting, and not
one speaking to her or taking the slightest notice
of her. She realized with a suddenness that
dazed her and blurred everything before her
country eyes that she was very, very different
from them—why, every one of the little girls was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
dressed in pure, soft white, with a beautiful
sash and bows; all wore pretty slippers. There
was not one copper-toed shoe among them!</p>

<p>Her heart came up into her thin, little throat
and beat and beat there. She wished that she
might sit down and hide her shoes, but then the
dress was just as bad. <i>That</i> couldn’t be hidden.
So she stood awkwardly in their midst, stiff and
motionless, with a look in her eyes that ought to
have touched somebody’s heart.</p>

<p>Then the “Liberty Car” came, drawn by six
noble white horses decorated with flags, ribbons
and rosettes, and stepping out oh, so proudly in
perfect time with the village band. Esther forgot
her buff calico dress and her copper-toed shoes in
the exquisite delight of that moment.</p>

<p>The little girls were placed in the car. Each
carried a banner on which was painted the name
of a state. What graceful, dancing little bodies
they were, and how their feet twinkled and could
not be quiet! When “Oregon” went proudly by,
Esther’s heart sank. She wondered which state
they would give to her.</p>

<p>The band stopped playing. All the girls were
seated; somehow there seemed to be no place left
for another. Esther went forward bravely
and set one copper-toed shoe on the step of the
car. The ladies in charge looked at her;
then, at each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span></p>

<p>“Hello, Country!” cried a boy’s shrill voice
behind her suddenly. “My stars! She thinks
she’s goin’ in the car. What a jay!”</p>

<p>Esther stood as if petrified with her foot still
on the step. She felt that they were all looking
at her. What terrible things human eyes can
be! A kind of terror took hold of her. She
trembled. There seemed to be a great stillness
about her.</p>

<p>“Can’t I go?” she said to one of the ladies.
Her heart was beating so hard and so fast in her
throat that her voice sounded far away to her.
“My paw knows Mr. Mallory, the store-keeper.
We live down by the river on the Nesley place.
We’re poor, but my paw alwus pays his debts. I
come with Mr. Hoover; he’s gone to put up the
horses.”</p>

<p>It was spoken—the poor little speech, at once
passionate and despairing as any prayer to God.
Then it was that Esther learned that there are
silences which are harder to bear than the wildest
tumult.</p>

<p>But presently one of the ladies said, very kindly—“Why,
I am so sorry, little girl, but you see—er—all
the little girls who ride in the car must—er—be
dressed in white.”</p>

<p>Esther removed her foot heavily from the
step and stood back.</p>

<p>“Oh, look!” cried “Oregon”, leaning from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
car. “She wanted to ride <i>in here</i>! In a yellow
calico dress and copper-toed shoes!”</p>

<p>Then the band played, the horses pranced and
tossed their heads, the flags and banners floated
on the breeze, and the beautiful car moved away.</p>

<p>Esther stood looking after it until she heard Mr.
Hoover’s voice at her side. “W’y, what a funny
little girl! There the car’s gone, an’ she didn’t
go an’ git in it, after all! Did anybody ever see
sech a funny little girl? After gittin’ up so airly,
an’ hurryin’ everybody so for fear she’d be late,
an’ a-talkin’ about ridin’ in the Libraty Car for
months—an’ then to go an’ not git in it after
all!”</p>

<p>Esther turned with a bursting heart. She
threw herself passionately into his arms and hid
her face on his breast.</p>

<p>“I want to go home,” she sobbed. “Oh, I
want to go home!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span></p>

<h3>THE BLOW-OUT AT JENKINS’S GROCERY</h3>

<p>The hands of the big, round clock in Mr. Jenkins’s
grocery store pointed to eleven. Mr. Jenkins
was tying a string around a paper bag containing
a dollar’s worth of sugar. He held one
end of the string between his teeth. His three
clerks were going around the store with little
stiff prances of deference to the customers they
were serving. It was the night before Christmas.
They were all so worn out that their attempts at
smiles were only painful contortions.</p>

<p>Mr. Jenkins looked at the clock. Then his
eyes went in a hurried glance of pity to a woman
sitting on a high stool close to the window. Her
feet were drawn up on the top rung, and her thin
shoulders stooped over her chest. She had
sunken cheeks and hollow eyes; her cheek-bones
stood out sharply.</p>

<p>For two hours she had sat there almost motionless.
Three times she had lifted her head and
fixed a strained gaze upon Mr. Jenkins and
asked, “D’yuh want to shet up?” Each time,
receiving an answer in the negative, she had sunk
back into the same attitude of brute-like waiting.</p>

<p>It was a wild night. The rain drove its long,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
slanting lances down the window-panes. The
wind howled around corners, banged loose shutters,
creaked swinging sign-boards to and fro, and
vexed the telephone wires to shrill, continuous
screaming. Fierce gusts swept in when the door
was opened.</p>

<p>Christmas shoppers came and went. The
woman saw nothing inside the store. Her
eyes were set on the doors of a brightly lighted
saloon across the street.</p>

<p>It was a small, new “boom” town on Puget
Sound. There was a saloon on every corner,
and a brass band in every saloon. The “establishment”
opposite was having its “opening” that
night. “At home” cards in square envelopes had
been sent out to desirable patrons during the
previous week. That day, during an hour’s sunshine,
a yellow chariot, drawn by six cream-colored
horses with snow-white manes and tails, had
gone slowly through the streets, bearing the members
of the band clad in white and gold. It was
followed by three open carriages, gay with the
actresses who were to dance and sing that night
on the stage in the rear of the saloon. All had
yellow hair and were dressed in yellow with white
silk sashes, and white ostrich plumes falling to
their shoulders. It was a gorgeous procession,
and it “drew.”</p>

<p>The woman lived out in the Grand View addition.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
The addition consisted mainly of cabins
built of “shakes” and charred stumps. The
grand view was to come some ten or twenty
years later on, when the forests surrounding the
addition had taken their departure. It was a full
mile from the store.</p>

<p>She had walked in with her husband through
the rain and slush after putting six small children
to bed. They were very poor. Her husband was
shiftless. It was whispered of them by their neighbors
that they couldn’t get credit for “two bits”
except at the saloons.</p>

<p>A relative had sent the woman ten dollars for a
Christmas gift. She had gone wild with joy.
Ten dollars! It was wealth. For once the
children should have a real Christmas—a good
dinner, toys, candy! Of all things, there should
be a wax doll for the little girl who had cried for
one every Christmas, and never even had one in
her arms. Just for this one time they should be
happy—like other children; and she should be
happy in their happiness—like other mothers.
What did it matter that she had only two calico
dresses and one pair of shoes, half-soled at that,
and capped across the toes?</p>

<p>Her husband had entered into her childish joy.
He was kind and affectionate—when he was sober.
That was why she had never had the heart to
leave him. He was one of those men who are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
always needing, pleading for—and, alas receiving—forgiveness;
one of those men whom their
women love passionately and cling to forever.</p>

<p>He promised her solemnly that he would not
drink a drop that Christmas—so solemnly that
she believed him. He had helped her to wash
the dishes and put the children to bed. And he
had kissed her.</p>

<p>Her face had been radiant when they came into
Mr. Jenkins’s store. That poor, gray face with its
sunken cheeks and eyes! They bought a turkey—and
with what anxious care she had selected it,
testing its tenderness, balancing it on her bony
hands, examining the scales with keen, narrowed
eyes when it was weighed; and a quart of cranberries,
a can of mince meat and a can of plum
pudding, a head of celery, a pint of Olympia
oysters, candy, nuts—and then the toys! She
trembled with eagerness. Her husband stood
watching her, smiling good-humoredly, his hands
in his pockets. Mr. Jenkins indulged in some
serious speculation as to where the money was
coming from to pay for all this “blow-out”. He
set his lips together and resolved that the “blow-out”
should not leave the store, under any amount
of promises, until the cash paying for it was in
his cash-drawer.</p>

<p>Suddenly the band began to play across the
street. The man threw up his head like an old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
war-horse at the sound of a bugle note. A fire
came into his eyes; into his face a flush of excitement.
He walked down to the window and
stood looking out, jingling some keys in his
pocket. He breathed quickly.</p>

<p>After a few moments he went back to his wife.
Mr. Jenkins had stepped away to speak to another
customer.</p>

<p>“Say, Molly, old girl,” he said affectionately,
without looking at her, “yuh can spare me
enough out o’ that tenner to git a plug o’ tobaccer
for Christmas, can’t yuh?”</p>

<p>“W’y—I guess so,” said she slowly. The
first cloud fell on her happy face.</p>

<p>“Well, jest let me have it, an’ I’ll run out an’
be back before yuh’re ready to pay for these
here things. I’ll only git two bits’ worth.”</p>

<p>She turned very pale.</p>

<p>“Can’t yuh git it here, Mart?”</p>

<p>“No,” he said in a whisper; “his’n ain’t fit to
chew. I’ll be right back, Molly—honest.”</p>

<p>She stood motionless, her eyes cast down,
thinking. If she refused, he would be angry and
remain away from home all the next day to pay
her for the insult. If she gave it to him—well,
she would have to take the chances. But oh, her
hand shook as she drew the small gold piece from
her shabby purse and reached it to him. His
big, warm hand closed over it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span></p>

<p>She looked up at him. Her eyes spoke the
passionate prayer that her lips could not utter.</p>

<p>“Don’t stay long, Mart,” she whispered, not
daring to say more.</p>

<p>“I won’t, Molly,” he whispered back. “I’ll
hurry up. Git anything yuh want.”</p>

<p>She finished her poor shopping. Mr. Jenkins
wrapped everything up neatly. Then he rubbed
his hands together and looked at her, and said:
“Well, there now, Mis’ Dupen.”</p>

<p>“I—jest lay ’em all together there on the
counter,” she said hesitatingly. “I’ll have to
wait till Mart comes back before I can pay yuh.”</p>

<p>“I see him go into the saloon over there,”
piped out the errand boy shrilly.</p>

<p>At the end of half an hour she climbed upon
the high stool and fixed her eyes upon the saloon
opposite and sat there.</p>

<p>She saw nothing but the glare of those windows
and the light streaming out when the doors
opened. She heard nothing but the torturing
blare of the music. After awhile something commenced
beating painfully in her throat and temples.
Her limbs grew stiff—she was scarcely
conscious that they ached. Once she shuddered
strongly, as dogs do when they lie in the cold,
waiting.</p>

<p>At twelve o’clock Mr. Jenkins touched her
kindly on the arm. She looked up with a start.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
Her face was gray and old; her eyes were almost
wild in their strained despair.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll have to shet up now, Mis’
Dupen,” he said apologetically. “I’m sorry—”</p>

<p>She got down from the stool at once. “I can’t
take them things,” she said, almost whispering.
“I hate to of put yuh to all that trouble of doin’
’em up. I thought—but I can’t take ’em. I hope
yuh won’t mind—very much.” Her bony
fingers twisted together under her thin shawl.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” said Mr. Jenkins in an
embarrassed way. She moved stiffly to the door.
He put out the lights and followed her. He felt
mean, somehow. For one second he hesitated,
then he locked the door, and gave it a shake to
make sure that it was all right.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “good night. I wish you a
mer—”</p>

<p>“Good night,” said the woman. She was
turning away when the doors of the saloon opened
for two or three men to enter. The music, which
had ceased for a few minutes, struck up another
air—a familiar air.</p>

<p>She burst suddenly into wild and terrible
laughter. “Oh, my Lord,” she cried out,

<h3>THE TAKIN’ IN OF OLD MIS’ LANE</h3>

<p>“Huhy! Huhy! Pleg take that muley cow!
Huhy!”</p>

<p>“What she doin’, maw?”</p>

<p>“Why, she’s just a-holdin’ her head over the
bars, an’ a-bawlin’! Tryin’ to get into the little
correll where her ca’f is! I wish paw ’d of done
as I told him an’ put her into the up meadow.
If there’s anything on earth I abominate it’s to
hear a cow bawl.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bridges gathered up several sticks of wood
from the box in the corner by the stove, and
going out into the yard, threw them with powerful
movements of her bare arm in the direction
of the bars. The cow lowered her hornless head
and shook it defiantly at her, but held her ground.
Isaphene stood in the open door, laughing. She
was making a cake. She beat the mixture with
a long-handled tin spoon while watching the
fruitless attack. She had reddish brown hair
that swept away from her brow and temples in
waves so deep you could have lost your finger in
any one of them; and good, honest gray eyes,
and a mouth that was worth kissing. She wore
a blue cotton gown that looked as if it had just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
left the ironing-table. Her sleeves were rolled to
her elbows.</p>

<p>“It don’t do any good, maw,” she said, as her
mother returned with a defeated air. “She just
bawls an’ shakes her head right in your face.
Look at her!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t want to look at her. It seems to
me your paw might of drove her to the up
meadow, seein’s he was goin’ right up by there.
It ain’t like as if he’d of had to go out o’ his
way. It aggravates me offul.”</p>

<p>She threw the last stick of wood into the box,
and brushed the tiny splinters off her arm and
sleeves.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I might as well string them
beans for dinner before I clean up.”</p>

<p>She took a large milkpan, filled with beans,
from the table and sat down near the window.</p>

<p>“Isaphene,” she said, presently, “what do you
say to an organ, an’ a horse an’ buggy? A horse
with some style about him, that you could ride or
drive, an’ that ’u’d always be up when you
wanted to go to town!”</p>

<p>“What do I say?” The girl turned and
looked at her mother as if she feared one of them
had lost her senses; then she returned to her
cake-beating with an air of good-natured disdain.</p>

<p>“Oh, you can smile an’ turn your head on one
side, but you’ll whistle another tune before long—or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
I’ll miss my guess. Isaphene, I’ve been savin’
up chicken an’ butter money ever since we come
to Puget Sound; then I’ve always got the money
for the strawberry crop, an’ for the geese an’
turkeys, an’ the calves, an’ so on. Your paw’s
been real good about such things.”</p>

<p>“I don’t call it bein’ good,” said Isaphene.
“Why shouldn’t he let you have the money?
You planted, an’ weeded, an’ picked the strawberries;
an’ you fed an’ set the chickens, an’
gethered the eggs; an’ you’ve had all the tendin’
of the geese an’ turkeys an’ calves—to say nothin’
of the cows bawlin’ over the bars,” she added,
with a sly laugh. “I’d say you only had your
rights when you get the money for such things.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, that’s fine talk.” Mrs. Bridges
nodded her head with an air of experience. “But
it ain’t all men-folks that gives you your rights;
so when one does, I say he deserves credit.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t claim anybody’d been good
to me just because he give me what I’d worked
for an’ earned. Now, if he’d give you all the
money from the potato patch every year, or the
hay meadow, or anything he’d done all the workin’
with himself—I’d call that good in him. He
never done anything like that, did he?”</p>

<p>“No, he never,” replied Mrs. Bridges, testily.
“An’ what’s more, he ain’t likely to—nor any
other man I know of! If you get a man that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
gives you all you work for an’ earn, you’ll be
lucky—with all your airs!”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I’ll manage to get my rights,
somehow,” said Isaphene, beginning to butter
the cake-pan.</p>

<p>“Somebody’s comin’!” exclaimed her mother,
lowering her voice to a mysterious whisper.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” Isaphene stood up straight,
with that little quick beating of mingled pleasure
and dismay that the cry of company brings to
country hearts.</p>

<p>“I can’t see. I don’t want to be caught peepin’.
I can see it’s a woman, though; she’s just passin’
the row of hollyhocks. Can’t you stoop down
an’ peep? She won’t see you ’way over there by
the table.”</p>

<p>Isaphene stooped and peered cautiously through
the wild cucumber vines that rioted over the
kitchen window.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s Mis’ Hanna!”</p>

<p>“My goodness! An’ the way this house looks!
You’ll have to bring her out here ’n the kitchen,
too. I s’pose she’s come to spend the day—she’s
got her bag with her, ain’t she?”</p>

<p>“Yes. What’ll we have for dinner? I ain’t
goin’ to cut this cake for her. I want this for
Sund’y.”</p>

<p>“Why, we’ve got corn beef to boil, an’ a head
o’ cabbage; an’ these here beans; an’, of course,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
potatoes; an’ watermelon perserves. An’ you
can make a custerd pie. I guess that’s a good
enough dinner for her. There! She’s knockin’.
Open the door, can’t you? Well, if I ever!
Look at that grease-spot on the floor!”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t spill it.”</p>

<p>“Who did, then, missy?”</p>

<p>“Well, <i>I</i> never.”</p>

<p>Isaphene went to the front door, returning
presently with a tall, thin lady.</p>

<p>“Here’s Mis’ Hanna, maw,” she said, with the
air of having made a pleasant discovery. Mrs.
Bridges got up, greatly surprised, and shook
hands with her visitor with exaggerated delight.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll declare! It’s really you, is it? At
last! Well, set right down an’ take off your
things. Isaphene, take Mis’ Hanna’s things.
My! ain’t it warm, walkin’?”</p>

<p>“It is so.” The visitor gave her bonnet to Isaphene,
dropping her black mitts into it after
rolling them carefully together. “But it’s always
nice an’ cool in your kitchen.” Her eyes
wandered about with a look of unabashed curiosity
that took in everything. “I brought my
crochet with me.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you did. You’ll have to excuse
the looks o’ things. Any news?”</p>

<p>“None perticular.” Mrs. Hanna began to crochet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
holding the work close to her face. “Ain’t
it too bad about poor, old Mis’ Lane?”</p>

<p>“What about her?” Mrs. Bridges snapped a
bean-pod into three pieces, and looked at her visitor
with a kind of pleased expectancy—as if almost
any news, however dreadful, would be
welcome as a relief to the monotony of existence.
“Is she dead?”</p>

<p>“No, she ain’t dead; but the poor, old creature
’d better be. She’s got to go to the poor-farm,
after all.”</p>

<p>There was silence in the big kitchen, save for
the rasp of the crochet needle through the wool
and the snapping of the beans. A soft wind came
in the window and drummed with the lightest of
touches on Mrs. Bridges’s temples. It brought all
the sweets of the old-fashioned flower-garden with
it—the mingled breaths of mignonette, stock,
sweet lavender, sweet peas and clove pinks. The
whole kitchen was filled with the fragrance. And
what a big, cheerful kitchen it was! Mrs. Bridges
contrasted it unconsciously with the poor-farm
kitchen, and almost shivered, warm though the
day was.</p>

<p>“What’s her childern about?” she asked,
sharply.</p>

<p>“Oh, her childern!” replied Mrs. Hanna, with
a contemptuous air. “What does her childern
amount to, I’d like to know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span></p>

<p>“Her son’s got a good, comf’table house an’
farm.”</p>

<p>“Well, what if he has? He got it with his
wife, didn’t he? An’ M’lissy won’t let his poor,
old mother set foot inside the house! I don’t say
she is a pleasant body to have about—she’s cross
an’ sick most all the time, an’ childish. But
that ain’t sayin’ her childern oughtn’t to put up
with her disagreeableness.”</p>

<p>“She’s got a married daughter, ain’t she?”</p>

<p>“Yes, she’s got a married daughter.” Mrs.
Hanna closed her lips tightly together and looked
as if she might say something, if she chose, that
would create a sensation.</p>

<p>“Well, ain’t she got a good enough home to
keep her mother in?”</p>

<p>“Yes, she has. But she got <i>her</i> home along
with her husband, an’ he won’t have the old soul
any more ’n M’lissy would.”</p>

<p>There was another silence. Isaphene had put
the cake in the oven. She knelt on the floor and
opened the door very softly now and then, to see
that it was not browning too fast. The heat of
the oven had crimsoned her face and arms.</p>

<p>“Guess you’d best put a piece o’ paper on top
o’ that cake,” said her mother. “It smells kind
o’ burny like.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right, maw.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bridges looked out the window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span></p>

<p>“Ain’t my flowers doin’ well, though, Mis’
Hanna?”</p>

<p>“They are that. When I come up the walk
I couldn’t help thinkin’ of poor, old Mis’ Lane.”</p>

<p>“What’s that got to do with her?” Resentment
bristled in Mrs. Bridges’s tone and look.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hanna stopped crocheting, but held her
hands stationary, almost level with her eyes, and
looked over them in surprise at her questioner.</p>

<p>“Why, she ust to live here, you know.”</p>

<p>“She did! In this house?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes. Didn’t you know that? Oh, they
ust to be right well off in her husband’s time. I
visited here consid’rable. My! the good things
she always had to eat. I can taste ’em yet.”</p>

<p>“Hunh! I’m sorry I can’t give you as good
as she did,” said Mrs. Bridges, stiffly.</p>

<p>“Well, as if you didn’t! You set a beautiful
table, Mis’ Bridges, an’, what’s more, that’s your
reputation all over. Everybody says that about
you.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bridges smiled deprecatingly, with a slight
blush of pleasure.</p>

<p>“They do, Mis’ Bridges. I just told you about
Mis’ Lane because you’d never think it now of
the poor, old creature. An’ such flowers as she
ust to have on both sides that walk! Lark-spurs,
an’ sweet-williams, an’ bach’lor’s-buttons, an’
mournin’-widows, an’ pumgranates, an’ all kinds.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
Guess you didn’t know she set out that pink cabbage-rose
at the north end o’ the front porch, did
you? An’ that hop-vine that you’ve got trained
over your parlor window—set that out, too. An’
that row o’ young alders between here an’ the
barn—she set ’em all out with her own hands; dug
the holes herself, an’ all. It’s funny she never
told you she lived here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” said Mrs. Bridges, slowly and
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder to me she never broke down
an’ cried when she was visitin’ here. She can’t
so much as mention the place without cryin’.”</p>

<p>A dull red came into Mrs. Bridges’s face.</p>

<p>“She never visited here.”</p>

<p>“Never visited here!” Mrs. Hanna laid her
crochet and her hands in her lap, and stared.
“Why, she visited ev’rywhere. That’s how she
managed to keep out o’ the poor-house so long.
Ev’rybody was reel consid’rate about invitin’ her.
But I expect she didn’t like to come here because
she thought so much o’ the place.”</p>

<p>Isaphene looked over her shoulder at her
mother, but the look was not returned. The
beans were sputtering nervously into the pan.</p>

<p>“Ain’t you got about enough, maw?” she
said. “That pan seems to be gettin’ hefty.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess.” She got up, brushing the
strings off her apron, and set the pan on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
table. “I’ll watch the cake now, Isaphene. You
put the beans on in the pot to boil. Put a piece
o’ that salt pork in with ’em. Better get ’em on
right away. It’s pretty near eleven. Ain’t this
oven too hot with the door shet?”</p>

<p>Then the pleasant preparations for dinner went
on. The beans soon commenced to boil, and an
appetizing odor floated through the kitchen. The
potatoes were pared—big, white fellows, smooth
and long—with a sharp, thin knife, round and
round and round, each without a break until the
whole paring had curled itself about Isaphene’s
pretty arm almost to the elbow. The cabbage was
chopped finely for the cold-slaw, and the vinegar
and butter set on the stove in a saucepan to heat.
Then Mrs. Bridges “set” the table, covering it
first with a red cloth having a white border and
fringe. In the middle of the table she placed an
uncommonly large, six-bottled caster.</p>

<p>“I guess you’ll excuse a red tablecloth, Mis’
Hanna. The men-folks get their shirt-sleeves so
dirty out in the fields that you can’t keep a white
one clean no time.”</p>

<p>“I use red ones myself most of the time,” replied
Mrs. Hanna, crocheting industriously. “It
saves washin’. I guess poor Mis’ Lane’ll have
to see the old place after all these years, whether
she wants or not. They’ll take her right past
here to the poor-farm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Bridges set on the table a white plate
holding a big square of yellow butter, and stood
looking through the open door, down the path
with its tall hollyhocks and scarlet poppies on
both sides. Between the house and the barn
some wild mustard had grown, thick and tall,
and was now drifting, like a golden cloud, against
the pale blue sky. Butterflies were throbbing
through the air, and grasshoppers were crackling
everywhere. It was all very pleasant and peaceful;
while the comfortable house and barns, the
wide fields stretching away to the forest, and the
cattle feeding on the hillside added an appearance
of prosperity. Mrs. Bridges wondered how
she herself would feel—after having loved the
place—riding by to the poor-farm. Then she
pulled herself together and said, sharply:</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you feel a draught, Mis’ Hanna,
a-settin’ so clost to the door.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my, no; I like it. I like lots o’ fresh
air. Can’t get it any too fresh for me. If I didn’t
have six childern an’ my own mother to keep, I’d
take her myself.”</p>

<p>“Take who?” Mrs. Bridges’s voice rasped
as she asked the question. Isaphene paused on
her way to the pantry, and looked at Mrs. Hanna
with deeply thoughtful eyes.</p>

<p>“Why, Mis’ Lane—who else?—before I’d let
her go to the poor-farm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I think her childern ought to be <i>made</i> to
take care of her!” Mrs. Bridges went on setting
the table with brisk, angry movements. “That’s
what I think about it. The law ought to take
holt of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see the law <i>has</i> took holt of it,”
said Mrs. Hanna, with a grim smile. “It seems
a shame that there ain’t somebody in the neighborhood
that ’u’d take her in. She ain’t much
expense, but a good deal o’ trouble. She’s sick,
in an’ out o’ bed, nigh onto all the time. My
opinion is she’s been soured by all her troubles;
an’ that if somebody ’u’d only take her in an’ be
kind to her, her temper’ment ’u’d emprove up
wonderful. She’s always mighty grateful for
ev’ry little chore you do her. It just makes my
heart ache to think o’ her a-havin’ to go to the
poor-house!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bridges lifted her head; all the softness
and irresolution went out of her face.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sorry for her,” she said, with an
air of dismissing a disagreeable subject; “but
the world’s full o’ troubles, an’ if you cried over
all o’ them you’d be a-cryin’ all the time. Isaphene,
you go out an’ blow that dinner-horn. I
see the men-folks ’av’ got the horses about foddered.
What did you do?” she cried out, sharply.
“Drop a smoothin’-iron on your hand? Well,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
my goodness! Why don’t you keep your eyes
about you? You’ll go an’ get a cancer yet!”</p>

<p>“I’m thinkin’ about buyin’ a horse an’ buggy,”
she announced, with stern triumph, when the girl
had gone out. “An’ an organ. Isaphene’s been
wantin’ one most offul. I’ve give up her paw’s
ever gettin’ her one. First a new harrow, an’
then a paten’ rake, an’ then a seed-drill—an’ then
my mercy”—imitating a masculine voice—“he
ain’t got any money left for silliness! But I’ve
got some laid by. I’d like to see his eyes when
he comes home an’ finds a bran new buggy with
a top an’ all, an’ a horse that he can’t hetch to a
plow, no matter how bad he wants to! I ain’t
sure but I’ll get a phaeton.”</p>

<p>“They ain’t so strong, but they’re handy to
get in an’ out of—’specially for old, trembly
knees.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t so old that I’m trembly!”</p>

<p>“Oh, my—no,” said Mrs. Hanna, with a little
start. “I was just thinkin’ mebbe sometimes
you’d go out to the poor-farm an’ take poor, old
Mis’ Lane for a little ride. It ain’t more’n five
miles from here, is it? She ust to have a horse
an’ buggy o’ her own. Somehow, I can’t get her
off o’ my mind at all to-day. I just heard about
her as I was a-startin’ for your house.”</p>

<p>The men came to the house. They paused on
the back porch to clean their boots on the scraper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
and wash their hands and faces with water dipped
from the rain-barrel. Their faces shone like
brown marble when they came in.</p>

<p class="tb">It was five o’clock when Mrs. Hanna, with a
sigh, began rolling the lace she had crocheted
around the spool, preparatory to taking her departure.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, “I must go. I had no idy
it was so late. How the time does go, a-talkin’.
I’ve had a right nice time. Just see how well
I’ve done—crocheted full a yard since dinner-time!
My! how pretty that hop-vine looks. It
makes awful nice shade, too. I guess when Mis’
Lane planted it she thought she’d be settin’ under
it herself to-day—she took such pleasure in it.”</p>

<p>The ladies were sitting on the front porch. It
was cool and fragrant out there. The shadow of
the house reached almost to the gate now. The
bees had been drinking too many sweets—greedy
fellows!—and were lying in the red poppies, droning
stupidly. A soft wind was blowing from Puget
Sound and turning over the clover leaves,
making here a billow of dark green and there one
of light green; it was setting loose the perfume
of the blossoms, too, and sifting silken thistle-needles
through the air. Along the fence was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
hedge, eight feet high, of the beautiful ferns that
grow luxuriantly in western Washington. The
pasture across the lane was a tangle of royal
color, being massed in with golden-rod, fire-weed,
steeple-bush, yarrow, and large field-daisies;
the cotton-woods that lined the creek at the side
of the house were snowing. Here and there the
sweet twin-sister of the steeple-bush lifted her pale
and fluffy plumes; and there was one lovely,
lavender company of wild asters.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bridges arose and followed her guest into
the spare bedroom.</p>

<p>“When they goin’ to take her to the poor-farm?”
she asked, abruptly.</p>

<p>“Day after to-morrow. Ain’t it awful? It
just makes me sick. I couldn’t of eat a bite o’
dinner if I’d stayed at home, just for thinkin’
about it. They say the poor, old creature ain’t
done nothin’ but cry an’ moan ever since she
knowed she’d got to go.”</p>

<p>“Here’s your bag,” said Mrs. Bridges. “Do
you want I should tie your veil?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks; I guess I won’t put it on. If I
didn’t have such a big fam’ly an’ my own mother
to keep, I’d take her in myself before I’d see her
go to the poor-house. If I had a small fam’ly
an’ plenty o’ room, I declare my conscience
wouldn’t let me sleep nights.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span></p>

<p>A deep red glow spread over Mrs. Bridges’s
face.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you needn’t to keep a-hintin’ for
me to take her,” she said, sharply.</p>

<p>“<i>You!</i>” Mrs. Hanna uttered the word in a
tone that was an unintentional insult; in fact,
Mrs. Bridges affirmed afterward that her look of
astonishment, and, for that matter, her whole air
of dazed incredulity were insulting. “I never
once thought o’ <i>you</i>,” she said, with an earnestness
that could not be doubted.</p>

<p>“Why not o’ me?” demanded Mrs. Bridges,
showing something of her resentment. “What
you been talkin’ an’ harpin’ about her all day
for, if you wasn’t hintin’ for me to take her in?”</p>

<p>“I never thought o’ such a thing,” repeated
her visitor, still looking rather helplessly dazed.
“I talked about it because it was on my mind,
heavy, too; an’, I guess, because I wanted to talk
my conscience down.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bridges cooled off a little and folded her
hands over the bedpost.</p>

<p>“Well, if you wasn’t hintin’,” she said, in a
conciliatory tone, “it’s all right. You kep’
harpin’ on the same string till I thought you was;
an’ it riles me offul to be hinted at. I’ll take
anything right out to my face, so’s I can answer
it, but I won’t be hinted at. But why”—having
rid herself of the grievance she at once swung<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
around to the insult—“why <i>didn’t</i> you think o’
me?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hanna cleared her throat and began to
unroll her mitts.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know just why,” she replied,
helplessly. She drew the mitts on, smoothing
them well up over her thin wrists. “I don’t know
why, I’m sure. I’d thought o’ most ev’rybody
in the neighborhood—but you never come into
my head <i>onct</i>. I was as innocent o’ hintin’ as a
babe unborn.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bridges drew a long breath noiselessly.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, absent-mindedly, “come
again, Mis’ Hanna. An’ be sure you always
fetch your work an’ stay the afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will. But it’s your turn to come
now. Where’s Isaphene?”</p>

<p>“I guess she’s makin’ a fire ’n the cook-stove
to get supper by.”</p>

<p>“Well, tell her to come over an’ stay all night
with Julia some night.”</p>

<p>“Well—I will.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bridges went into the kitchen and sat
down, rather heavily, in a chair. Her face wore
a puzzled expression.</p>

<p>“Isaphene, did you hear what we was a-sayin’
in the bedroom?”</p>

<p>“Yes, most of it, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you s’pose was the reason she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
never thought o’ me a-takin’ Mis’ Lane in? Says
she’d thought o’ ev’rybody else.”</p>

<p>“Why, you never thought o’ takin’ her in
yourself, did you?” said Isaphene, turning down
the damper of the stove with a clatter. “I don’t
see how anybody else ’u’d think of it when you
didn’t yourself.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you think it was offul impadent
in her to say that, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. She told the truth.”</p>

<p>“Why ought they to think o’ ev’rybody takin’
her exceptin’ me, I’d like to know.”</p>

<p>“Because ev’rybody else, I s’pose, has thought
of it theirselves. The neighbors have all been
chippin’ in to help her for years. You never
done nothin’ for her, did you? You never invited
her to visit here, did you?”</p>

<p>“No, I never. But that ain’t no sayin’ I
wouldn’t take her as quick ’s the rest of ’em.
They ain’t none of ’em takin’ her in very fast,
be they?”</p>

<p>“No, they ain’t,” said Isaphene, facing her
mother with a steady look. “They ain’t a one
of ’em but ’s got their hands full—no spare room,
an’ lots o’ childern or their folks to take care of.”</p>

<p>“Hunh!” said Mrs. Bridges. She began chopping
cold boiled beef for hash.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I’ll sleep to-night for thinkin’
about it,” she said, after a while.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span></p>

<p>“I won’t neither, maw. I wish she wasn’t
goin’ right by here.”</p>

<p>“So do I.”</p>

<p>After a long silence Mrs. Bridges said—“I
don’t suppose your paw’d hear to us a-takin’ her
in.”</p>

<p>“I guess he’d hear to ’t if we would,” said
Isaphene, dryly.</p>

<p>“Well, we can’t do’t; that’s all there is about
it,” announced Mrs. Bridges, with a great air of
having made up her mind. Isaphene did not reply.
She was slicing potatoes to fry, and she
seemed to agree silently with her mother’s decision.
Presently, however, Mrs. Bridges said, in
a less determined tone—“There’s no place to put
her in, exceptin’ the spare room—an’ we can’t
get along without that, noways.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Isaphene, in a non-committal tone.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bridges stopped chopping and looked
thoughtfully out of the door.</p>

<p>“There’s this room openin’ out o’ the kitchen,”
she said, slowly. “It’s nice an’ big an’ sunny.
It ’u’d be handy ’n winter, bein’ right off o’ the
kitchen. But it ain’t furnished up.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Isaphene, “it ain’t.”</p>

<p>“An’ I know your paw’d never furnish it.”</p>

<p>Isaphene laughed. “No, I guess not,” she
said.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s no use a-thinkin’ about it, Isaphene;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
we just can’t take her. Better get them
potatoes on; I see the men-folks comin’ up to the
barn.”</p>

<p>The next morning after breakfast Isaphene
said suddenly, as she stood washing dishes—“Maw,
I guess you’d better take the organ money
an’ furnish up that room.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bridges turned so sharply she dropped
the turkey-wing with which she was polishing
the stove.</p>

<p>“You don’t never mean it,” she gasped.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. I know we’d both feel better to
take her in than to take in an organ”—they both
laughed rather foolishly at the poor joke. “You
can furnish the room real comf’table with what
it ’u’d take to buy an organ; an’ we can get the
horse an’ buggy, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Isaphene, I’ve never meant but what you
should have an organ. I know you’d learn fast.
You’d soon get so’s you could play ‘Lilly Dale’
an’ ‘Hazel Dell;’ an’ you might get so’s you
could play ‘General Persifer F. Smith’s Grand
March.’ No, I won’t never spend that money
for nothin’ but an organ—so you can just shet
up about it.”</p>

<p>“I want a horse an’ buggy worse, maw,” said
Isaphene, after a brief but fierce struggle with
the dearest desire of her heart. “We can get a
horse that I can ride, too. An’ we’ll get a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
phaeton, so’s we can take Mis’ Lane to church
an’ around.” Then she added, with a regular
masterpiece of diplomacy—“We’ll show the
neighbors that when we do take people in, we
take ’em in all over!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Isaphene,” said her mother, weakly,
“wouldn’t it just astonish ’em!”</p>

<p class="tb">It was ten o’clock of the following morning
when Isaphene ran in and announced that she
heard wheels coming up the lane. Mrs. Bridges
paled a little and breathed quickly as she put on
her bonnet and went out to the gate.</p>

<p>A red spring-wagon was coming slowly toward
her, drawn by a single, bony horse. The driver
was half asleep on the front seat. Behind, in a
low chair, sat old Mrs. Lane; she was stooping
over, her elbows on her knees, her gray head
bowed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bridges held up her hand, and the driver
pulled in the unreluctant horse.</p>

<p>“How d’you do, Mis’ Lane? I want that you
should come in an’ visit me a while.”</p>

<p>The old creature lifted her trembling head and
looked at Mrs. Bridges; then she saw the old
house, half hidden by vines and flowers, and her
dim eyes filled with bitter tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span></p>

<p>“We ain’t got time to stop, ma’am,” said
the driver, politely. “I’m a takin’ her to the
county,” he added, in a lower tone, but not so low
that the old woman did not hear.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to make time,” said Mrs. Bridges,
bluntly. “You get down an’ help her out.
You don’t have to wait. When I’m ready for
her to go to the county, I’ll take her myself.”</p>

<p>Not understanding in the least, but realizing,
as he said afterwards, that she “meant business”
and wasn’t the kind to be fooled with, the man
obeyed with alacrity.</p>

<p>“Now, you lean all your heft on me,” said
Mrs. Bridges, kindly. She put her arm around
the old woman and led her up the hollyhock path,
and through the house into the pleasant kitchen.</p>

<p>“Isaphene, you pull that big chair over here
where it’s cool. Now, Mis’ Lane, you set right
down an’ rest.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane wiped the tears from her face with
an old cotton handkerchief. She tried to speak,
but the sobs had to be swallowed down too fast.
At last she said, in a choked voice—“It’s awful
good in you—to let me see the old place—once
more. The Lord bless you—for it. But I’m
most sorry I stopped—seems now as if I—just
<i>couldn’t</i> go on.”</p>

<p>“Well, you ain’t goin’ on,” said Mrs. Bridges,
while Isaphene went to the door and stood looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
toward the hill with drowned eyes. “This
is our little joke—Isaphene’s an’ mine. This’ll
be your home as long as it’s our’n. An’ you’re
goin’ to have this nice big room right off o’ the
kitchen, as soon ’s we can furnish it up. An’
we’re goin’ to get a horse an’ buggy—a <i>low</i>
buggy, so’s you can get in an’ out easy like—an’
take you to church an’ all around.”</p>

<p class="tb">That night, after Mrs. Bridges had put Mrs.
Lane to bed and said good-night to her, she went
out on the front porch and sat down; but presently,
remembering that she had not put a candle
in the room, she went back, opening the door
noiselessly, not to disturb her. Then she stood
perfectly still. The old creature had got out of
bed and was kneeling beside it, her face buried
in her hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord God,” she was saying aloud, “bless
these kind people—bless ’em, oh, Lord God!
Hear a poor, old mis’rable soul’s prayer, an’ bless
’em! An’ if they’ve ever done a sinful thing,
oh, Lord God, forgive ’em for it, because they’ve
kep’ me out o’ the poor-house—”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bridges closed the door, and stood sobbing
as if her heart must break.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span></p>

<p>“What’s the matter, maw?” said Isaphene,
coming up suddenly.</p>

<p>“Never you mind what’s the matter,” said her
mother, sharply, to conceal her emotion. “You
get to bed, an’ don’t bother your head about
what’s the matter of me.”</p>

<p>Then she went down the hall and entered her
own room; and Isaphene heard the key turned
in the lock.</p>

</div>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span></p>

<h3>THE MANEUVERING OF MRS. SYBERT</h3>

<p>“Why, mother, where are you a-goin’, all
dressed up so?”</p>

<p>Mr. Sybert stood in the bedroom door and
stared at his wife’s ample back. There was a
look of surprise in his blue eyes. Mrs. Sybert
stooped before the bureau, and opened the middle
drawer, taking hold of both handles and watching
it carefully as she drew it toward her. Sometimes
it came out crookedly; and every one knows
that a drawer that opens crookedly, will, in time,
strain and rub the best bureau ever made. From
a red pasteboard box that had the picture of a
pretty actress on the cover, Mrs. Sybert took a
linen handkerchief that had been ironed until it
shone like satin. After smoothing an imaginary
wrinkle out of it, she put it into her pocket, set
her bonnet a little further over her forehead,
pushing a stray lock sternly where it belonged,
adjusted her bonnet-strings, which were so wide
and so stiff that they pressed her ears away from
her head, giving her a bristling appearance, and
buttoned her gloves with a hair-pin; then, having
gained time and decided upon a reply, she
said, cheerfully, “What’s that, father?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span></p>

<p>“Well, it took you a right smart spell to
answer, didn’t it? I say, where are you a-goin’,
all dressed up so?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sybert took her black silk bag with round
spots brocaded upon it, and put its ribbons
leisurely over her arm. “I’m a-goin’ to see
Mis’ Nesley,” she said.</p>

<p>Her husband’s face reddened. “What’s that
you say, mother? You’re a-goin’ to do <i>what</i>?
I reckon I’m a-goin’ a little deef.”</p>

<p>“I’m a-goin’ to see Mis’ Nesley.” Mrs. Sybert
spoke calmly. No one would have suspected
that she was reproaching herself for not getting
out of the house ten minutes sooner. “He
never’d ’a’ heard a thing about it,” she was
thinking; but she looked straight into his eyes.
Her eyelids did not quiver.</p>

<p>The red in Mr. Sybert’s face deepened. He
stood in the door, so she could not pass. Indeed,
she did not try. Mrs. Sybert had not studied
signs for nothing during the thirty years she had
been a wife. “I reckon you’re a-foolin’, mother,”
he said. “Just up to some o’ your devilment!”</p>

<p>“No, I ain’t up to no devilment, father,” she
said, still calmly. “You’d best let me by, now,
so’s I can go; it’s half after two.”</p>

<p>“D’ you mean to say that you’re a-ne’rnest?
A-talkin’ about goin’ to see that <i>hussy</i> of a Mis’
Nesley?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I’m a-ne’rnest,” said Mrs. Sybert, firmly.
“She ain’t a hussy, as I know of. What you
got agin ’er, I’d like to know?”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> ain’t got anything agin ’er. Now, what’s
the sense o’ you’re a-pretendin’ you don’t know
the talk about ’er, mother?” Mr. Sybert’s tone
had changed slightly. He did not like the poise
of his wife’s body; it bespoke determination—a
fight to the finish if necessary. “You know
she’s be’n the town talk fer five years. Your
own tawngue hez run on about ’er like’s if ’t was
split in the middle an’ loose at both en’s. There
wa’n’t a woman in town that spoke to ’er”——</p>

<p>“There was men, though, that did,” said Mrs.
Sybert, calmly. “I rec’lect bein’ in at Mis’
Carney’s one day, an’ seein’ you meet ’er opposite
an’ take off your hat to ’er—bowin’ an’ scrapin’
right scrumptious like.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sybert changed his position uneasily, and
cleared his throat. “Well, that’s diff’rent,” he
said. “I ust to know ’er before ’er husband
died”——</p>

<p>“Well, I ust to know ’er, then, too,” said Mrs.
Sybert, quietly.</p>

<p>“Well, you hed to stop speakin’ to ’er after
she got to actin’ up so, but it wa’n’t so easy fer
me to stop biddin’ ’er the time o’ day.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” said Mrs. Sybert, stolidly.</p>

<p>“Why not!” repeated her husband, loudly; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
was losing his temper. “What’s the sense o’
your actin’ the fool so, mother? Why, if I’d ’a’
set myself up as bein’ too virtjus to speak to ’er
ev’ry man in town ’u’d ’a’ be’n blagg’ardin’ me
about bein’ so mighty good!”</p>

<p>“Why <i>sh’u’dn’t</i> you be so mighty good, father?
You expect me to be, I notice.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sybert choked two or three times. His
face was growing purplish.</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>damn</i>!” he burst out. Then he looked
frightened. “Now, see here, mother! You’re
aggravatin’ me awful. You know as well as me
that men ain’t expected to be as good all their
lives as women”——</p>

<p>“Why ain’t they expected to?” Mrs. Sybert’s
tone and look were stern.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why they ain’t, mother, but I
know they <i>ain’t</i> expected to—an’ I know they
ain’t as <i>good</i>, ’ither.” This last was a fine bit
of diplomacy. But it was wasted.</p>

<p>“They ain’t as good, aigh? Well, the reason
they ain’t as good is just because they ain’t expected
to be! That’s just the reason. You can’t
get around that, can you, father?”</p>

<p>Evidently he could not.</p>

<p>“An’ now,” continued Mrs. Sybert, “that she’s
up an’ married Mr. Nesley an’ wants to live a
right life, I’m a-goin’ to see her.”</p>

<p>“How d’you know she wants to live a right
life?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know it, father. I just <i>reckon</i> she
does. When you wanted I sh’u’d marry you,
my father shook his head, an’ says—‘Lucindy, I
do’ know what to say. John’s be’n a mighty fast
young fello’ to give a good girl to fer the askin’,’
but I says—‘Well, father, I reckon he wants to
start in an’ live a right life now.’ An’ so I reckon
that about Mis’ Nesley.”</p>

<p>“God A’mighty, mother!” exclaimed Mr. Sybert,
violently. “That’s diff’rent. Them things
ain’t counted the same in men. Most all men
nowadays sow their wild oats an’ then settle down,
an’ ain’t none the worse for it. It just helps ’em
to appreciate good women, an’ to make good
husbands.”</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon Mis’ Nesley knows how to appreciate
a good man by this time,” said Mrs.
Sybert, with unintentional irony. “I reckon
she’s got all her wild oats sowed, an’ is ready to
settle down an’ make a good wife. So I’m goin’
to see ’er. Let me by, father. I’ve fooled a ha’f
an hour away now, when I’d ort to ’a’ be’n on
the road there.”</p>

<p>“Now, see here, mother. You ain’t goin’ a
step. The whole town’s excited over a nice man
like Mr. Nesley a-throwin’ hisself away on a no-account
woman like her, an’ you sha’n’t be seen
a-goin’ there an’ upholdin’ her.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sybert looked long and steadily into her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
husband’s eyes. It was her policy to fight until
she began to lose ground, and then to quietly turn
her forces to maneuvering. “I reckon,” she was
now reflecting; “it’s about time to begin maneuv’rin’.”</p>

<p>“Well, father,” she said, mildly; “I’ve made
up my mind to go an’ see Mis’ Nesley an’ encourage
her same’s I w’u’d any man that wanted to
live better. An’ I’m a-goin’.”</p>

<p>“You <i>ain’t</i> a-goin’!” thundered Mr. Sybert.
“I forbid you to budge a step! You sha’n’t disgrace
yourself, Mrs. Sybert, if you do want to,
while you’re my wife!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sybert untied her bonnet strings, and laid
her bag on the foot of the bed. “All right,
father,” she said, “I won’t go till you tell me I
can. I always hev tried to do just as you wanted
I sh’u’d.”</p>

<p>She went into another room to take off her best
dress. Mr. Sybert stood staring after her, speechless.
He had the dazed look of a cat that falls
from a great height and alights, uninjured, upon
its feet. The maneuvering had commenced.</p>

<p>Mr. Sybert spent the afternoon at the postoffice
grocery store. It was a pleasant place to sit.
There was always a cheerful fire in the rusty box-stove
in the back room, and there were barrels and
odds and ends of chairs scattered around, whereon
men who had an hour to squander might sit and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
talk over the latest scandal. Men, as it is well
known, are above the petty gossip as to servants
and best gowns which women enjoy; but, without
scruple or conscience, they will talk away a
woman’s character, even when they see her struggling
to live down a misfortune or sin and begin a
new life. There are many characters talked away
in the back rooms of grocery stores.</p>

<p>It was six o’clock when he went home. As he
went along the narrow plank walk, he thought of
the good supper that would be awaiting him, and
his heart softened to “mother.”</p>

<p>“I reckon I was too set,” he reflected. “There
ain’t many women as good an’ faithful as mother.
I don’t see what got it into her head to go to see
that Mis’ Nesley—an’ to talk up so to me. She
never done that afore.”</p>

<p>The door was locked. In surprise he fumbled
about in the dark for the seventh flower-pot in
the third row, where mother always hid the key.
Yes, it was there. But his knees shook a little
as he entered the house. He could not remember
that he had ever found her absent at supper time
since the children were married. Some of the
neighbors must be sick. In that case she would
have left a note; and he lighted the kitchen candle,
and searched for it. It was pinned to a cushion
on the bureau in the bedroom. The house
was cold, but he did not wait to kindle a fire.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
He sat down by the bureau, and with fingers
somewhat clumsier than usual, adjusted his spectacles
over his high, thin nose. Then, leaning
close to the candle, he read the letter, the composition
of which must have given “mother”
some anxious hours. It was written with painful
precision.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Father</span>: You will find the coald meat in
the safe out on the back porch in the stun crock covered
up with a pie pan. The apple butter is in the big peory
jar down in the seller with a plate and napkeen tied over
it. Put them back on when you get some out so the ants
wont get into. There’s a punkin pie on the bottom shelf
of the pantree to the right side of the door as you go in,
and some coffy in the mill all ground. I’m offul sorry I
hadent time to fix supper. I hev gone to Johns and Marias
to stay tell you come after me and I don’t want that
you shud come tell you change your mind bout Mis Nesley,
if it takes till dumesday to change it. I aint never
gone against you in anythin before, but I haf to this time.
Im goin to stay at Johns and Marias tell you come of
yourself and get me. You dont haf to say nothin before
John and Maria except just well mother Ive come after
you. Then I’ll know you meen I can go and see Mis
Nesley.</p>

<p>“Well father I reckon youll be surprised but Ive been
thinkin bout that poor woman and us not givin her a
chanse after what Christ said bout castin the first stun.
He didnt make no difrence between mens and womens
sins and I dont perpose to. There aint a woman alive
thats worse than haff the men are when they conclud to
settle down and live right and if you give men a chanse
youve got to give women a chanse too. They both got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
soles an I reckon thats what Gods thinkin bout. I married
you and give you a chanse and I reckon youd best
do as much fer Mis Nesley.</p>

<p>“If you dont come fer me Ill live at Johns and Marias
and I want that you shud keep all the things but the hit
and miss rag carpet. I dont think I cud get along without
that. Marias are all wove in stripes and look so
comon. And my cloze and one fether bed and pillow.
Well thats all.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Mother.</span>”</p>

<p>“I laid out your clean undercloze on the foot of the
bed and your sox with them.”</p>

</div>

<p>One fine afternoon the following week Mrs.
Sybert, looking through the geraniums in Maria’s
kitchen window, saw her husband drive up to the
gate. She did not look surprised.</p>

<p>“Here’s father come to get me, Maria,” she
said, lifting her voice.</p>

<p>Maria came out of the pantry with flour on her
hands and arms and stood waiting. Mr. Sybert
came in, stamping, and holding his head high and
stiffly. He had a lofty and condescending air.</p>

<p>“Well, mother,” he said, “I’ve come after
you.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mrs. Sybert, “set down till I
get on my things. I’ve had a right nice vis’t,
but I’m glad to get home. Did you find the apple
butter?”</p>

<p>On the road home Mrs. Sybert talked cheerfully
about John and Maria and their domestic affairs.
Mr. Sybert listened silently. He held his body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
erect, looking neither to the right nor to the left.
He did not speak until they approached Mr. Nesley’s
gate. Then he said, with firmness and dignity:</p>

<p>“Mother, I’ve b’en thinkin’ that you’d best go
an’ see Mis’ Nesley, after all. I changed my mind
down at the postoffice groc’ry store that same
afternoon an’ went home, meanin’ to tell you I
wanted you sh’u’d go an’ see ’er—but you was
gone to John’s an’ Maria’s. I reckon you’d best
stop right now an’ have it over.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mrs. Sybert.</p>

<p>She descended meekly over the front wheel.
There was not the slightest air of triumph about
her until she got inside the gate. Then a smile
went slowly across her face. But her husband
did not see it. He was looking out of the corners
of his eyes at the house across the road. Mrs.
Deacon, the druggist’s wife, and all her children
had their faces flattened against the window.</p>

<p>Mr. Sybert’s determination kept his head high,
but not his spirit.</p>

<p>“God A’mighty!” he groaned. “The whole
town’ll know it to-morrow. I’d rather die than
face that groc’ry store—after the way I’ve went
on about people upholdin’ of her!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span></p>

<h3>A POINT OF KNUCKLING-DOWN<br />
IN THREE PARTS</h3>

<h4>PART I</h4>

<p>Emarine went along the narrow hall and passed
through the open door. There was something
in her carriage that suggested stubbornness. Her
small body had a natural backward sway, and
the decision with which she set her heels upon
the floor had long ago caused the readers of
character in the village to aver that “Emarine
Endey was contrairier than any mule.”</p>

<p>She wore a brown dress, a gray shawl folded
primly around her shoulders, and a hat that tried
in vain to make her small face plain. There
was a frill of white, cheap lace at her slender
throat, fastened in front with a cherry ribbon.
Heavy gold earrings with long, shining pendants
reached almost to her shoulders. They quivered
and glittered with every movement.</p>

<p>Emarine was pretty, in spite of many freckles
and the tightness with which she brushed her
hair from her face and coiled it in a sleek knot at
the back of her head. “Now, be sure you get it
just so slick, Emarine,” her mother would say,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
watching her steadily while she combed and
brushed and twisted her long tresses.</p>

<p>As Emarine reached the door her mother followed
her down the hall from the kitchen. The
house was old, and two or three loose pieces in
the flooring creaked as she stepped heavily upon
them.</p>

<p>“Oh, say, Emarine!”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“You get an’ bring home a dollar’s worth o’
granylated sugar, will you?”</p>

<p>“Well.”</p>

<p>“An’ a box o’ ball bluin’. Mercy, child!
Your dress-skirt sags awful in the back. Why
don’t you run a tuck in it?”</p>

<p>Emarine turned her head over her shoulder
with a birdlike movement, and bent backward,
trying to see the offensive sag.</p>

<p>“Can’t you pin it up, maw?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess. Have you got a pin? Why,
Emarine Endey! If ever I see in all my born
days! What are you a-doin’ with a red ribbon
on you—an’ your Uncle Herndon not cold in his
grave yet! A fine spectickle you’d make o’
yourself, a-goin’ the length an’ the breadth o’ the
town with that thing a-flarin’ on you. You’ll
disgrace this whole fambly yet! I have to keep
watch o’ you like a two-year-old baby. Now,
you get an’ take it right off o’ you; an’ don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
you let me ketch you a-puttin’ it on again till a
respectful time after he’s be’n dead. I never
hear tell o’ such a thing.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what a red ribbon’s got to do
with Uncle Herndon’s bein’ dead,” said Emarine.</p>

<p>“Oh, you don’t, aigh? Well, <i>I</i> see. You
act as if you didn’t have no feelin’.”</p>

<p>“Well, goin’ without a red ribbon won’t make
me feel any worse, will it, maw?”</p>

<p>“No, it won’t. Emarine, what does get into
you to act so tantalizin’? I guess it’ll look a
little better. I guess the neighbors won’t talk
quite so much. You can see fer yourself how
they talk about Mis’ Henspeter because she wore
a rose to church before her husband had be’n
dead a year. All she had to say fer herself was
that she liked flowers, an’ didn’t sense it ’u’d be
any disrespect to her husband to wear it—seein’s
he’d always liked ’em, too. They all showed
her ’n a hurry what they thought about it. She’s
got narrow borders on all her han’kachers, too,
a’ready.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you stay away from such people?”
said Emarine. “Old gossips! You know I
don’t care what the neighbors say—or think,
either.”</p>

<p>“Well, <i>I</i> do. The land knows they talk a
plenty even without givin’ ’em anything to talk
about. You get an’ take that red ribbon off o’
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll take it off if you want I sh’u’d.”
She unfastened it deliberately and laid it on a
little table. She had an exasperating air of being
unconvinced and of complying merely for the
sake of peace.</p>

<p>She gathered her shawl about her shoulders
and crossed the porch.</p>

<p>“Emarine!”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Who’s that a-comin’ over the hill path? I
can’t make out the dress. It looks some like
Mis’ Grandy, don’t it?”</p>

<p>Emarine turned her head. Her eyelids quivered
closer together in an effort to concentrate
her vision on the approaching guest.</p>

<p>“Well, I never!” exclaimed her mother, in
a subdued but irascible tone. “There you go—a-lookin’
right square at her, when I didn’t want
that she sh’u’d know we saw her! It does seem
to me sometimes, Emarine, that you ain’t got
good sense.”</p>

<p>“I’d just as soon she knew we saw her,” said
Emarine, unmoved. “It’s Miss Presly, maw.”</p>

<p>“Oh, land o’ goodness! That old sticktight?
She’ll stay all day if she stays a minute. Set
an’ set! An’ there I’ve just got the washin’ all
out on the line, an’ she’ll tell the whole town we
wear underclo’s made out o’ unbleached muslin!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
Are you sure it’s her? It don’t look overly like
her shawl.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s her.”</p>

<p>“Well, go on an’ stop an’ talk to her, so ’s to
give me a chance to red up some. Don’t ferget
the ball bluin’, Emarine.”</p>

<p>Emarine went down the path and met the
visitor just between the two tall lilac trees, whose
buds were beginning to swell.</p>

<p>“Good mornin’, Miss Presly.”</p>

<p>“Why, good mornin’, Emarine. Z’ your
maw to home?”</p>

<p>“Yes ’m.”</p>

<p>“I thought I’d run down an’ set a spell with
her, an’ pass the news.”</p>

<p>Emarine smiled faintly and was silent.</p>

<p>“Ain’t you goin’ up town pretty early fer
washday?”</p>

<p>“Yes ’m.”</p>

<p>“I see you hed a beau home from church las’
night.”</p>

<p>Emarine’s face flushed; even her ears grew
rosy.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess he’s a reel nice young man,
anyways, Emarine. You needn’t to blush so.
Mis’ Grandy was a-sayin’ she thought you’d done
offul well to git him. He owns the house an’ lot
they live in, an’ he’s got five hunderd dollars in
the bank. I reckon he’ll have to live with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
ol’ lady, though, when he gits married. They
do say she’s turrable hard to suit.”</p>

<p>Emarine lifted her chin. The gold pendants
glittered like diamonds.</p>

<p>“It don’t make any difference to me whuther
she’s hard to suit or easy,” she said. “I’ll have
to be goin’ on now. Just knock at the front door,
Miss Presly.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can go right around to the back, just
as well, an’ save your maw the trouble o’ comin’
to the door. If she’s got her washin’ out, I
can stoop right under the clo’s line.”</p>

<p>“Well, we like to have our comp’ny come to
the front door,” said Emarine, dryly.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful morning in early spring.
The alders and the maples along the hill were
wrapped in reddish mist. The saps were mounting
through delicate veins. Presently the mist
would quicken to a pale green as the young
leaves unfolded, but as yet everything seemed to
be waiting. The brown earth had a fresh, woody
smell that caused the heart to thrill with a vague
sense of ecstasy—of some delight deep hidden
and inexplicable. Pale lavender “spring beauties”
stood shyly in groups or alone, in sheltered
places along the path. There was even, here and
there, a trillium—or white lily, as the children
called it—shivering on its slender stem. There
were old stumps, too, hollowed out by long-spent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
flames into rustic urns, now heaped to their ragged
rims with velvet moss. On a fence near a
meadow-lark was pouring out its few, but full and
beautiful, notes of passion and desire. Emarine
paused to listen. Her heart vibrated with exquisite
pain to the ravishment of regret in those
liquid tones.</p>

<p>“Sounds as if he was sayin’—‘<i>Sweet—oh—Sweet—my
heart is breaking!</i>’” she said; and then
with a kind of shame of the sentiment in such a
fancy, she went on briskly over the hill. Her
heels clicked sharply on the hard road.</p>

<p>Before she reached the long wooden stairs which
led from the high plateau down to the one street
of Oregon City, Emarine passed through a beautiful
grove of firs and cedars. Already the firs were
taking on their little plushy tufts of pale green,
and exuding a spicy fragrance. Occasionally a
last year’s cone drew itself loose and sunk noiselessly
into a bed of its own brown needles. A
little way from the path a woodpecker clung to a
tree, hammering into the tough bark with its long
beak. As Emarine approached, it flew heavily
away, the undersides of its wings flashing a scarlet
streak along the air.</p>

<p>As her eyes ceased following its flight, she became
aware that some one was standing in the
path, waiting. A deep, self-conscious blush swept
over her face and throat. “Emarine never does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
anything up by halves,” her mother was wont to
declare. “When she blushes, she <i>blushes</i>!”</p>

<p>She stepped slowly toward him with a sudden
stiff awkwardness.</p>

<p>“Oh—you, is it, Mr. Parmer?” she said, with
an admirable attempt—but an attempt only—at
indifference.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s me,” said the young fellow, with an
embarrassed laugh. With a clumsy shuffle he
took step with her. Both faces were flaming.
Emarine could not lift her eyes from their contemplation
of the dead leaves in her path—yet
she passed a whole company of “spring beauties”
playing hide-and-seek around a stump, without
seeing them. Her pulses seemed full of little
hammers, beating away mercilessly. Her fingers
fumbled nervously with the fringes on her shawl.</p>

<p>“Don’t choo want I sh’u’d pack your umberell
fer yuh?” asked the young man, solemnly.</p>

<p>“Why—yes, if you want.”</p>

<p>It was a faded thing she held toward him, done
up rather baggily, too; but he received it as reverently
as if it had been a twenty-dollar silk one
with a gold handle.</p>

<p>“Does your mother know I kep’ yuh comp’ny
home from church last night?”</p>

<p>“Unh-hunh.”</p>

<p>“What ’id she say?”</p>

<p>“She didn’t say much.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span></p>

<p>“Well, what?”</p>

<p>“Oh, not much.” Emarine was rapidly recovering
her self-possession. “I went right in an’
up an’ told her.”</p>

<p>“Well, why can’t choo tell me what she said?
Emarine, yuh can be the contrairiest girl when
yuh want.”</p>

<p>“Can I?” She flashed a coquettish glance at
him. She was quite at her ease by this time, although
the color was still burning deep in her
cheeks. “I sh’u’dn’t think you’d waste so much
time on contrairy people, Mr. Parmer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Emarine, go on an’ tell me!”</p>

<p>“Well”—Emarine laughed mirthfully—“she
put the backs of her hands on her hips—this way!”
She faced him suddenly, setting her arms akimbo,
the shawl’s fringes quivering over her elbows;
her eyes fairly danced into his. “An’ she looked
at me a long time; then she says—‘Hunh! <i>You—leetle—heifer!</i>
You think you’re some pun’kins,
don’t you? A-havin’ a beau home from meetin’.”</p>

<p>Both laughed hilariously.</p>

<p>“Well, what else ’id she say?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you want to know. Do you—sure?”</p>

<p>“I cross my heart.”</p>

<p>“Well—she said it c’u’dn’t happen more’n
ev’ry once ’n so often.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span></p>

<p>“She did.”</p>

<p>The young man paused abruptly. A narrow,
unfrequented path led through deeper woods to
the right.</p>

<p>“Emarine, let’s take this catecornered cut
through here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m afraid it’s longer—an’ it’s washday,
you know,” said Emarine, with feeble resistance.</p>

<p>“We’ll walk right fast. Come on. George!
But it’s nice and sweet in here, though!”</p>

<p>They entered the path. It was narrow and the
great trees bent over and touched above them.</p>

<p>There was a kind of soft lavender twilight falling
upon them. It was very still, save for the
fluttering of invisible wings and the occasional
shrill scream of a blue-jay.</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> sweet in here,” said Emarine.</p>

<p>The young man turned quickly, and with a
deep, asking look into her lifted eyes, put his
arms about her and drew her to him. “Emarine,”
he said, with passionate tenderness. And
then he was silent, and just stood holding her
crushed against him, and looking down on her
with his very soul in his eyes. Oh, but a man
who refrains from much speech in such an hour
has wisdom straight from the gods themselves!</p>

<p>After a long silence Emarine lifted her head and
smiled trustfully into his eyes. “It’s washday,”
she said, with a flash of humor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span></p>

<p>“So it is,” he answered her, heartily. “An’
I promised yuh we’d hurry up—an’ I alwus keep
my promises. But first—Emarine—”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Yuh must say somethin’ first.”</p>

<p>“Say what, Mr. Parmer?”</p>

<p>“‘<i>Mr. Parmer!</i>’” His tone and his look
were reproachful. “Can’t choo say Orville?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can—if you want I sh’u’d.”</p>

<p>“Well, I do want choo sh’u’d, Emarine.
Now, yuh know what else it is I want choo
sh’u’d say before we go on.”</p>

<p>“Why, no, I don’t—hunh-unh.” She shook
her head, coquettishly.</p>

<p>“Emarine”—the young fellow’s face took on
a sudden seriousness—“I want choo to say yuh’ll
marry me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my, no!” cried Emarine. She turned
her head on one side, like a bird, and looked at
him with lifted brows and surprised eyes. One
would have imagined that such a thought had
never entered that pretty head before.</p>

<p>“What, Emarine! Yuh won’t?” There was
consternation in his voice.</p>

<p>“Oh, my, no!” Both glance and movement
were full of coquettishness. The very fringes of
the demure gray shawl seemed to have taken on
new life and vivacity.</p>

<p>Orville Palmer’s face turned pale and stern.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
He drew a long breath silently, not once removing
that searching look from her face.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” he said, calmly, “I want to
know what choo mean by up an’ lettin’ me kiss
yuh—if yuh don’t mean to marry me.”</p>

<p>This was an instant quietus to the girl’s coquetry.
She gave him a startled glance. A
splash of scarlet came into each cheek. For a
moment there was utter silence. Then she made
a soft feint of withdrawing from his arms. To
her evident amazement, he made no attempt to
detain her. This placed her in an awkward dilemma,
and she stood irresolutely, with her eyes
cast down.</p>

<p>Young Palmer’s arms fell at his sides with a
movement of despair. Sometimes they were
ungainly arms, but now absence of self-consciousness
lent them a manly grace.</p>

<p>“Well, Emarine,” he said, kindly, “I’ll go
back the way I come. Goodby.”</p>

<p>With a quick, spontaneous burst of passion—against
which she had been struggling, and
which was girlish and innocent enough to carry
a man’s soul with it into heaven—Emarine cast
herself upon his breast and flung her shawl-entangled
arms about his shoulders. Her eyes
were earnest and pleading, and there were tears
of repentance in them. With a modesty that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
was enchanting she set her warm, sweet lips
tremblingly to his, of her own free will.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean it,” she whispered. “I was
only a—a-foolin’.”</p>

<p class="tb">The year was older by a month when one
morning Mrs. Endey went to the front door and
stood with her body swaying backward, and one
rough hand roofing the rich light from her eyes.</p>

<p>“Emarine ’ad ought to ’a’ got to the hill path
by this time,” she said, in a grumbling tone.
“It beats me what keeps her so! I reckon she’s
a-standin’ like a bump on a lawg, watchin’ a red
ant or a tumble-bug, or some fool thing! She’d
leave her dish-washin’ any time an’ stand at the
door a-ketchin’ cold in her bare arms, with the
suds a-drippin’ all over her apron an’ the floor—a-listenin’
to one o’ them silly meadow-larks
hollerin’ the same noise over ’n over. Her paw’s
women-folks are all just such fools.”</p>

<p>She started guiltily and lowered her eyes to
the gate which had clicked sharply.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she said. “That you, Emarine?”
She laughed rather foolishly. “I was lookin’
right over you—lookin’ <i>fer</i> you, too. Miss
Presly’s be’n here, an’ of all the strings she had
to tell! Why, fer pity’s sake! Is that a dollar’s
worth o’ coffee?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, it is; an’ I guess it’s full weight, too,
from the way my arm feels! It’s just about
broke.”</p>

<p>“Well, give it to me, an’ come on out in the
kitching. I’ve got somethin’ to tell you.”</p>

<p>Emarine followed slowly, pinning a spray of
lilac bloom in her bosom as she went.</p>

<p>“Emarine, where’s that spring balance at?
I’m goin’ to weigh this coffee. If it’s one grain
short, I’ll send it back a-flyin’. I’ll show ’em
they can’t cheat this old hen!”</p>

<p>She slipped the hook under the string and
lifted the coffee cautiously until the balance was
level with her eyes. Then standing well back
on her heels and drawing funny little wrinkles
up around her mouth and eyes, she studied the
figures earnestly, counting the pounds and the
half-pounds down from the top. Finally she
lowered it with a disappointed air. “Well,” she
said, reluctantly, “it’s just it—just to a ’t.’
They’d ought to make it a leetle over, though, to
allow fer the paper bag. Get the coffee-canister,
Emarine.”</p>

<p>When the coffee had all been jiggled through
a tin funnel into the canister, Mrs. Endey sat
down stiffly and began polishing the funnel with
a cloth. From time to time she glanced at Emarine
with a kind of deprecatory mystery. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
last she said—“Miss Presly spent the day down’t
Mis’ Parmer’s yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Did she?” said Emarine, coldly; but the
color came into her cheeks. “Shall I go on with
the puddin’?”</p>

<p>“Why, you can if you want. She told me
some things I don’t like.”</p>

<p>Emarine shattered an egg-shell on the side of a
bowl and released the gold heart within.</p>

<p>“Miss Presly says once Mis’ Parmer had to go
out an’ gether the eggs an’ shet up the chickens,
so Miss Presly didn’t think there’d be any harm
in just lookin’ into the drawers an’ things to see
what she had. She says she’s awful short on
table cloths—only got three to her name! An’
only six napkeens, an’ them coarse ’s anything!
When Mis’ Parmer come back in, Miss Presly
talked around a little, then she says—‘I s’pose
you’re one o’ them spic an’ span kind, Mis’ Parmer,
that alwus has a lot o’ extry table cloths put
away in lavender.’”</p>

<p>Emarine set the egg-beater into the bowl and
began turning it slowly.</p>

<p>“Mis’ Parmer got mighty red all of a sudden;
but she says right out—‘No, I’m a-gettin’
reel short on table cloths an’ things, Miss Presly,
but I ain’t goin’ to replenish. Orville’s thinkin’
o’ gettin’ married this year, an’ I guess Emarine’ll
have a lot o’ extry things.’ An’ then she ups<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
an’ laughs an’ says—‘I’ll let her stock up the
house, seein’s she’s so anxious to get into it.’”</p>

<p>Emarine had turned pale. The egg-beater fairly
flew round and round. A little of the golden
foam slipped over the edge of the bowl and slid
down to the white table.</p>

<p>“Miss Presly thinks a good deal o’ you, Emarine,
so that got her spunk up; an’ she just told
Mis’ Parmer she didn’t believe you was dyin’ to
go there an’ stock up her drawers fer her. Says
she—‘I don’t think young people ’ad ought to
live with mother-in-laws, any way.’ Said she
thought she’d let Mis’ Parmer put that in her
pipe an’ smoke it when she got time.”</p>

<p>There was a pulse in each side of Emarine’s
throat beating hard and full. Little blue, throbbing
cords stood out in her temples. She went
on mixing the pudding mechanically.</p>

<p>“Then Mis’ Parmer just up an’ said with a
tantalizin’ laugh that if you didn’t like the
a-commodations at her house, you needn’t to come
there. Said she never did like you, anyways, ner
anybody else that set their heels down the way
you set your’n. Said she’d had it all out with
Orville, an’ he’d promised her faithful that if there
was any knucklin’-down to be done, you’d be the
one to do it, an’ not her!”</p>

<p>Emarine turned and looked at her mother. Her
face was white with controlled passion. Her eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
burned. But her voice was quiet when she spoke.</p>

<p>“I guess you’d best move your chair,” she said,
“so ’s I can get to the oven. This puddin’ ’s all
ready to go in.”</p>

<p>When she had put the pudding in the oven she
moved about briskly, clearing the things off the
table and washing them. She held her chin high.
There was no doubt now about the click of her
heels; it was ominous.</p>

<p>“I won’t marry him!” she cried at last, flinging
the words out. “He can have his mother an’
his wore-out table cloths!” Her voice shook.
The muscles around her mouth were twitching.</p>

<p>“My mercy!” cried her mother. She had a
frightened look. “Who cares what his mother
says? I w’u’dn’t go to bitin’ off my nose to spite
my face, if I was you!”</p>

<p>“Well, I care what he says. I’ll see myself
knucklin’-down to a mother-in-law!”</p>

<p>“Well, now, don’t go an’ let loose of your
temper, or you’ll be sorry fer it. You’re alwus
mighty ready a-tellin’ me not to mind what folks
say, an’ to keep away from the old gossips.”</p>

<p>“Well, you told me yourself, didn’t you? I
can’t keep away from my own mother very well,
can I?”</p>

<p>“Well, now, don’t flare up so! You’re worse
’n karosene with a match set to it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span></p>

<p>“What ’id you tell me for, if you didn’t want
I sh’u’d flare up?”</p>

<p>“Why, I thought it ’u’d just put you on your
mettle an’ show her she c’u’dn’t come it over
you.” Then she added, diplomatically changing
her tone as well as the subject—“Oh, say,
Emarine, I wish you’d go up in the antic an’
bring down a bunch o’ pennyrile. I’ll watch the
puddin’.”</p>

<p>She laughed with dry humor when the girl was
gone. “I got into a pickle that time. Who ever
’d ’a’ thought she’d get stirred up so? I’ll have
to manage to get her cooled down before Orville
comes to-night. They ain’t many matches like
him, if his mother <i>is</i> such an old scarecrow. He
ain’t so well off, but he’ll humor Emarine up.
He’d lay down an’ let her walk on him, I guess.
There’s Mis’ Grisley b’en a-tryin’ fer months to
get him to go with her Lily—<i>Lily</i>, with a complexion
like sole-leather!—an’ a-askin’ him up
there all the time to dinner, an’ a-flatterin’ him
up to the skies. I’d like to know what they always
name dark-complected babies Lily fer! Oh,
did you get the pennyrile, Emarine? I was
laughin’ to myself, a-wond’rin’ what Mis’ Grisley’s
Lily’ll say when she hears you’re goin’ to
marry Orville.”</p>

<p>Emarine hung a spotless dish-cloth on two
nails behind the stove, but did not speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Endey turned her back to the girl and
smiled humorously.</p>

<p>“That didn’t work,” she thought. “I’ll have
to try somethin’ else.”</p>

<p>“I’ve made up my mind to get you a second-day
dress, too, Emarine. You can have it any
color you want—dove-color ’d be awful nice.
There’s a hat down at Mis’ Norton’s milliner’
store that ’u’d go beautiful with dove-color.”</p>

<p>Emarine took some flat-irons off the stove, wiped
them carefully with a soft cloth and set them
evenly on a shelf. Still she did not speak. Mrs.
Endey’s face took on an anxious look.</p>

<p>“There’s some beautiful artaficial orange flowers
at Mis’ Norton’s, Emarine. You can be married
in ’em, if you want. They’re so reel they
almost smell sweet.”</p>

<p>She waited a moment, but receiving no reply,
she added with a kind of desperation—“An’ a
veil, Emarine—a long, white one a-flowin’ down
all over you to your feet—one that ’u’d just
make Mis’ Grisley’s Lily’s mouth water. What
do you say to that? You can have that, too, if
you want.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t want!” said Emarine, fiercely.
“Didn’t I say I wa’n’t goin’ to marry him? I’ll
give him his walking-chalk when he comes to-night.
I don’t need any help about it, either.”</p>

<p>She went out, closing the door as an exclamation
point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span></p>

<p>Oregon City kept early hours. The curfew
ringing at nine o’clock on summer evenings gathered
the tender-aged of both sexes off the street.</p>

<p>It was barely seven o’clock when Orville Palmer
came to take Emarine out for a drive. He
had a high top-buggy, rather the worse for wear,
and drove a sad-eyed, sorrel horse.</p>

<p>She was usually ready to come tripping down
the path, to save his tying the horse. To-night
she did not come. He waited a while. Then he
whistled and called—“Oh, Emarine!”</p>

<p>He pushed his hat back and leaned one elbow
on his knee, flicking his whip up and down, and
looking steadily at the open door. But she did
not come. Finally he got out and, tying his horse,
went up the path slowly. Through the door he
could see Emarine sitting quietly sewing. He
observed at once that she was pale.</p>

<p>“Sick, Emarine?” he said, going in.</p>

<p>“No,” she answered, “I ain’t sick.”</p>

<p>“Then why under the sun didn’t choo come
when I hollowed?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t want to.” Her tone was icy.</p>

<p>He stared at her a full minute. Then he burst
out laughing. “Oh, say, Emarine, yuh can be
the contrariest girl I ever see! Yuh do love to
tease a fellow so. Yuh’ll have to kiss me fer
that.”</p>

<p>He went toward her. She pushed her chair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
back and gave him a look that made him pause.</p>

<p>“How’s your mother?” she asked.</p>

<p>“My mother?” A cold chill went up and
down his spine. “Why—oh, she’s all right.
Why?”</p>

<p>She took a small gold ring set with a circle of
garnets from her finger and held it toward him
with a steady hand.</p>

<p>“You can take an’ show her this ring, an’ tell
her I ain’t so awful anxious to stock her up on
table cloths an’ napkeens as she thinks I am.
Tell her yuh’ll get some other girl to do her
knucklin’-down fer her. I ain’t that kind.”</p>

<p>The young man’s face grew scarlet and then
paled off rapidly. He looked like a man accused
of a crime. “Why, Emarine,” he said, feebly.</p>

<p>He did not receive the ring, and she threw it on
the floor at his feet. A whole month she had
slept with that ring against her lips—the bond
of her love and his! Now, it was only the emblem
of her “knuckling-down” to another woman.</p>

<p>“You needn’t to stand there a-pretendin’ you
don’t know what I mean.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t, Emarine.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you do, too. Didn’t you promise your
mother that if there was any knucklin’-down to
be did, I’d be the one to do it, an’ not her?”</p>

<p>“Why—er—Emarine—”</p>

<p>She laughed scornfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t go to tryin’ to get out of it. You know
you did. Well, you can take your ring, an’ your
mother, an’ all her old duds. I don’t want any
o’ you.”</p>

<p>“Emarine,” said the young man, looking guilty
and honest at the same time, “the talk I had
with my mother didn’t amount to a pinch o’ snuff.
It wa’n’t anything to make yuh act this way.
She don’t like yuh just because I’m goin’ to marry
yuh”—</p>

<p>“Oh, but you ain’t,” interrupted Emarine, with
an aggravating laugh.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am, too. She kep’ naggin’ at me day
an’ night fer fear yuh’d be sassy to her an’ she’d
have to take a back seat.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what’s the matter with her!” interrupted
Emarine. “She’s got the big-head.
She thinks ev’ry body wants to rush into her old
house, an’ marry her son, an’ use her old things!
She wants to make ev’rybody toe <i>her</i> mark.”</p>

<p>“Emarine! She’s my mother.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if she is. I w’u’dn’t tech her
with a ten-foot pole.”</p>

<p>“She’ll be all right after we’re married, Emarine,
an’ she finds out how—how nice yuh are.”</p>

<p>His own words appealed to his sense of the
ridiculous. He smiled. Emarine divined the
cause of his reluctant amusement and was instantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
furious. Her face turned very white.
Her eyes burned out of it like two fires.</p>

<p>“You think I ain’t actin’ very nice now, don’t
you? I don’t care what you think, Orville Parmer,
good or bad.”</p>

<p>The young man stood thinking seriously.</p>

<p>“Emarine,” he said, at last, very quietly, “I
love yuh an’ yuh know it. An’ yuh love me.
I’ll alwus be good to yuh an’ see that choo ain’t
emposed upon, Emarine. An’ I think the world
an’ all of yuh. That’s all I got to say. I can’t
see what ails yuh, Emarine.... When
I think o’ that day when I asked yuh to marry
me.... An’ that night I give yuh the
ring”—the girl’s eyelids quivered suddenly and
fell. “An’ that moonlight walk we took along
by the falls.... Why, it seems as if
this can’t be the same girl.”</p>

<p>There was such a long silence that Mrs.
Endey, cramping her back with one ear pressed
to the keyhole of the door, decided that he had
won and smiled dryly.</p>

<p>At last Emarine lifted her head. She looked
at him steadily. “Did you, or didn’t you, tell
your mother I’d have to do the knucklin’-down?”</p>

<p>He shuffled his feet about a little.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I did, Emarine, but I didn’t
mean anything. I just did it to get a little
peace.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span></p>

<p>The poor fellow had floundered upon an unfortunate
excuse.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the girl, contemptuously. Her
lip curled. “An’ so you come an’ tell me the
same thing for the same reason—just to get a
little peace! A pretty time you’d have a-gettin’
any peace at all, between the two of us! You’re
chickenish—an’ I hate chickenish people.”</p>

<p>“Emarine!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wish you’d go.” There was an almost
desperate weariness in her voice.</p>

<p>He picked up the ring with its shining garnet
stars, and went.</p>

<p>Mrs. Endey tiptoed into the kitchen.</p>

<p>“My back’s about broke.” She laughed
noiselessly. “I swan I’m proud o’ that girl.
She’s got more o’ me in her ’n I give her credit
fer. The idee o’ her a-callin’ him chickenish
right out to his face! That done me good.
Well, I don’t care such an awful lot if she don’t
marry him. A girl with that much spunk deserves
a <i>gov’nor</i>! An’ that mother o’ his’n ’s
a case. I guess her an’ me ’d ’a’ fit like cats an’
dogs, anyhow.” Her lips unclosed with reluctant
mirth.</p>

<p class="tb">The next morning Emarine arose and went
about her work as usual. She had not slept.
But there were no signs of relenting, or of regret,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
in her face. After the first surreptitious look at
her, Mrs. Endey concluded that it was all settled
unchangeably. Her aspiring mind climbed from
a governor to a United States senator. There
was nothing impossible to a girl who could break
her own heart at night and go about the next
morning setting her heels down the way Emarine
was setting hers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Endey’s heart swelled with triumph.</p>

<p>Emarine washed the dishes and swept the
kitchen. Then she went out to sweep the porch.
Suddenly she paused. A storm of lyric passion
had burst upon her ear; and running through it
she heard the words—“<i>Sweet—oh—Sweet—my
heart is breaking!</i>”</p>

<p>The girl trembled. Something stung her eyes
sharply.</p>

<p>Then she pulled herself together stubbornly.
Her face hardened. She went on sweeping with
more determined care than usual.</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon,” she said, with a kind of
fierce philosophy, “it ’u’d ’a’ been breaking a
good sight worse if I’d ’a’ married him an’ that
mother o’ his’n. That’s some comfort.”</p>

<p>But when she went in she closed the door carefully,
shutting out that impassioned voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span></p>

<h4>PART II</h4>

<p>It was eight o’clock of a June morning. It
had rained during the night. Now the air was
sweet with the sunshine on the wet leaves and
flowers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Endey was ironing. The table stood
across the open window, up which a wild honey-suckle
climbed, flinging out slender, green shoots,
each topped with a cluster of scarlet spikes.
The splendor of the year was at its height. The
flowers were marching by in pomp and magnificence.</p>

<p>Mrs. Endey spread a checked gingham apron
on the ironing cloth. It was trimmed at the
bottom with a ruffle, which she pulled and
smoothed with careful fingers.</p>

<p>She selected an iron on the stove, set the
wooden handle into it with a sharp, little click,
and polished it on a piece of scorched newspaper.
Then she moved it evenly across the starched
apron. A shining path followed it.</p>

<p>At that moment some one opened the gate.
Mrs. Endey stooped to peer through the vines.</p>

<p>“Well, ’f I ever ’n all my natcherl life!” she
said, solemnly. She set the iron on its stand
and lifted her figure erect. She placed one hand
on her hip, and with the other rubbed her chin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
in perplexed thought. “If it ain’t Orville Parmer,
you may shoot me! That beats me! I
wonder ’f he thinks Emarine’s a-dyin’ o’ love
fer him!”</p>

<p>Then a thought came that made her feel faint.
She fell into a chair, weakly. “Oh, my land!”
she said. “I wonder ’f that <i>ain’t</i> what’s the
matter of her! I never’d thought o’ that. I’d
thought o’ ev’rything <i>but</i> that. I wonder!
There she’s lied flat o’ her back ever sence she
fell out with him a month ago. Oh, my mercy!
I wonder ’f that is it. Here I’ve b’en rackin’
my brains to find out what ails ’er.”</p>

<p>She got up stiffly and went to the door. The
young man standing there had a pale, anxious
face.</p>

<p>“Good-mornin’, Mis’ Endey,” he said. He
looked with a kind of entreaty into her grim
face. “I come to see Emarine.”</p>

<p>“Emarine’s sick.” She spoke coldly.</p>

<p>“I know she is, Mis’ Endey.” His voice shook,
“If it wa’n’t fer her bein’ sick, I w’u’dn’t be
here. I s’pose, after the way she sent me off, I
ain’t got any spunk or I w’u’dn’t ’a’ come anyway;
but I heard—”</p>

<p>He hesitated and looked away.</p>

<p>“What ’id you hear?”</p>

<p>“I heard she wa’n’t a-goin’ to—get well.”</p>

<p>There was a long silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span></p>

<p>“Is she?” he asked, then. His voice was
low and broken.</p>

<p>Mrs. Endey sat down. “I do’ know,” she
said, after another silence. “I’m offul worried
about her, Orville. I can’t make out what ails
’er. She won’t eat a thing; even floatin’ island
turns agi’n ’er—an’ she al’ays loved that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mis’ Endey, can’t I see ’er?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see ’s it ’u’d be any use. Emarine’s
turrable set. ’F you hadn’t went an’ told your
mother that if there was any knucklin’-down to
be did between her an’ Emarine, Emarine ’u’d
have to do it, you an’ her’d ’a’ b’en married by
this time. I’d bought most ha’f her weddin’
things a’ready.”</p>

<p>The young man gave a sigh that was almost a
groan. He looked like one whose sin has found
him out. He dropped into a chair, and putting
his elbows on his knees, sunk his face into his
brown hands.</p>

<p>“Good God, Mis’ Endey!” he said, with
passionate bitterness. “Can’t choo ever stop
harpin’ on that? Ain’t I cursed myself day an’
night ever sence? Oh, I wish yuh’d help me!”
He lifted a wretched face. “I didn’t mean anything
by tellin’ my mother that; she’s a-gettin’
kind o’ childish, an’ she was afraid Emarine ’u’d
run over ’er. But if she’ll only take me back,
she’ll have ev’rything her own way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span></p>

<p>A little gleam of triumph came into Mrs.
Endey’s face. Evidently the young man was
rapidly becoming reduced to a frame of mind desirable
in a son-in-law.</p>

<p>“Will you promise that, solemn, Orville Parmer?”
She looked at him sternly.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mis’ Endey, I will—solemn.” His
tone was at once wretched and hopeful. “I’ll
promise anything under the sun, ’f she’ll only
fergive me. I can’t <i>live</i> without ’er—an’ that’s
all there is about it. Won’t choo ask her to see
me, Mis’ Endey?”</p>

<p>“Well, I do’ know,” said Mrs. Endey, doubtfully.
She cleared her throat, and sat looking at
the floor, as if lost in thought. He should never
have it to say that she had snapped him up too
readily. “I don’t feel much like meddlin’. I
must say I side with Emarine. I do think”—her
tone became regretful—“a girl o’ her spir’t
deserves a gov’nor.”</p>

<p>“I know she does,” said the young man,
miserably. “I alwus knew <i>I</i> wa’n’t ha’f good
enough fer ’er. But Mis’ Endey, I know she
loves me. Won’t choo—”</p>

<p>“Well!” Mrs. Endey gave a sigh of resignation.
She got up very slowly, as if still undecided.
“I’ll see what she says to ’t. But I’ll
tell you right out I sha’n’t advise ’er, Orville.”</p>

<p>She closed the door behind her with deliberate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
care. She laughed dryly as she went up stairs,
holding her head high. “There’s nothin’ like
makin’ your own terms,” she said, shrewdly.</p>

<p>She was gone a long time. When Orville
heard her coming lumbering back down the
stairs and along the hall, his heart stopped
beating.</p>

<p>Her coming meant—everything to him; and
it was so slow and so heavy it seemed ominous.
For a moment he could not speak, and her face
told him nothing. Then he faltered out—“Will
she? Oh, don’t choo say she won’t!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mrs. Endey, with a sepulchral
sigh, “she’ll see you, but I don’t know ’s anything
’ll come of it. Don’t you go to bracin’ up
on that idee, Orville Parmer. She’s set like a
strip o’ calico washed in alum water.”</p>

<p>The gleam of hope that her first words had
brought to his face was transitory. “You can
come on,” said Mrs. Endey, lifting her chin
solemnly.</p>

<p>Orville followed her in silence.</p>

<p>The little room in which Emarine lay ill was
small and white, like a nun’s chamber. The
ceiling slanted on two sides. There was white
matting on the floor; there was an oval blue rug
of braided rags at the side of the bed, and another
in front of the bureau. There was a small
cane-seated and cane-backed rocker. By the side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
of the bed was a high, stiff wooden chair, painted
very black and trimmed with very blue roses.</p>

<p>There were two or three pictures on the walls.
The long curtains of snowy butter-cloth were
looped high.</p>

<p>The narrow white bed had been wheeled
across the open window, so Emarine could lie and
look down over the miles of green valley, with
the mellifluous Willamette winding through it
like a broad silver-blue ribbon. By turning her
head a little she could see the falls; the great
bulk of water sliding over the precipice like glass,
to be crushed into powdered foam and flung high
into the sunlight, and then to go seething on down
to the sea.</p>

<p>At sunrise and at sunset the mist blown up in
long veils from the falls quickened of a sudden
to rose and gold and purple, shifting and blending
into a spectral glow of thrilling beauty. It
was sweeter than guests to Emarine.</p>

<p>The robins were company, too, in the large
cherry tree outside of her window; and sometimes
a flight of wild canaries drifted past like a
yellow, singing cloud. When they sank, swiftly
and musically, she knew that it was to rest upon
a spot golden with dandelions.</p>

<p>Outside the door of this room Mrs. Endey
paused. “I don’t see ’s it ’u’d be proper to let
you go in to see ’er alone,” she said, sternly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span></p>

<p>Orville’s eyes were eloquent with entreaty.
“Lord knows there w’u’dn’t be any harm in ’t,”
he said, humbly but fervently. “I feel jest as if
I was goin’ in to see an angel.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endey’s face softened; but at once a smile
came upon it—one of those smiles of reluctant,
uncontrollable humor that take us unawares
sometimes, even in the most tragic moments.
“She’s got too much spunk fer an angel,” she
said.</p>

<p>“Don’t choo go to runnin’ of her down!”
breathed Orville, with fierce and reckless defiance.</p>

<p>“I wa’n’t a-runnin’ of her down,” retorted
Mrs. Endey, coldly. “You don’t ketch me
a-runnin’ of my own kin down, Orville Parmer!”
She glowered at him under drawn brows. “An’
I won’t stand anybody else’s a-runnin’ of ’em
down or a-walkin’ over ’em, either! There ain’t
no call fer <i>you</i> to tell me not to run ’em down.”
Her look grew blacker. “I reckon we’d best
settle all about your mother before we go in there,
Orville Parmer.”</p>

<p>“What about ’er?” His tone was miserable;
his defiance was short-lived.</p>

<p>“Why, there’s no use ’n your goin’ in there
unless you’re ready to promise that you’ll give
Emarine the whip-hand over your mother. You
best make up your mind.”</p>

<p>“It’s <i>made</i> up,” said the young fellow, desperately.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
“Lord Almighty, Mis’ Endey, it’s made
up.”</p>

<p>“Well.” She turned the door-knob. “I
know it ain’t the thing, an’ I’d die if Miss Presley
sh’u’d come an’ find out—the town w’u’dn’t
hold her, she’d talk so! Well! Now, don’t
stay too long. ’F I see anybody a-comin’ I’ll
cough at the foot o’ the stairs.”</p>

<p>She opened the door and when he had passed
in, closed it with a bitter reluctance. “It ain’t
the proper thing,” she repeated; and she stood
for some moments with her ear bent to the keyhole.
A sudden vision of Miss Presley coming
up the stairs to see Emarine sent her down to the
kitchen with long, cautious strides, to keep guard.</p>

<p>Emarine was propped up with pillows. Her
mother had dressed her in a white sacque, considering
it a degree more proper than a night-dress.
There was a wide ruffle at the throat,
trimmed with serpentine edging. Emarine was
famous for the rapidity with which she crocheted,
as well as for the number and variety of her patterns.</p>

<p>Orville went with clumsy noiselessness to the
white bed. He was holding his breath. His
hungry eyes had a look of rising tears that are
held back. They took in everything—the girl’s
paleness and her thinness; the beautiful dark
hair, loose upon the pillow; the blue veins in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
her temples; the dark lines under her languid
eyes.</p>

<p>He could not speak. He fell upon his knees,
and threw one arm over her with compelling
passion, but carefully, too, as one would touch a
flower, and laid his brow against her hand. His
shoulders swelled. A great sob struggled from
his breast. “Oh, Emarine, Emarine!” he
groaned. Then there was utter silence between
them.</p>

<p>After a while, without lifting his head, he
pushed her sleeve back a very little and pressed
trembling, reverent lips upon the pulse beating
irregularly in her slim wrist.</p>

<p>“Oh, Emarine!” he said, still without lifting
his head. “I love yuh—I love yuh! I’ve suffered—oh,
to think o’ you layin’ here sick,
night after night fer a whole month, an’ me not
here to do things fer yuh. I’ve laid awake imaginin’
that yuh wanted a fresh drink an’ c’u’dn’t
make anybody hear; or that yuh wanted a cool
cloth on your forrid, or a little jell-water, or
somethin’. I’ve got up ’n the middle o’ the
night an’ come an’ stood out at your gate tell I’d
see a shado’ on the curt’n an’ know yuh wa’n’t
alone.... Oh, Emarine, Emarine!”</p>

<p>She moved her hand; it touched his throat
and curved itself there, diffidently. He threw up
his head and looked at her. A rush of passionate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
startled joy stung through him like needles,
filling his throat. He trembled strongly. Then
his arms were about her and he had gathered her
up against his breast; their lips were shaking
together, after their long separation, in those
kisses but one of which is worth a lifetime of all
other kisses.</p>

<p>Presently he laid her back very gently upon
her pillow, and still knelt looking at her with
his hand on her brow. “I’ve tired yuh,” he
said, with earnest self-reproach. “I won’t do ’t
ag’in, Emarine—I promise. When I looked ’n
your eyes an’ see that yuh’d fergive me; when I
felt your hand slip ’round my neck, like it ust to,
an’ like I’ve b’en <i>starvin’</i> to feel it fer a month,
Emarine—I c’u’dn’t help it, nohow; but I won’t
do ’t ag’in. Oh, to think that I’ve got choo
back ag’in!”</p>

<p>He laid his head down, still keeping his arm
thrown, lightly and tenderly as a mother’s, over
her.</p>

<p>The sick girl looked at him. Her face settled
into a look of stubbornness; the exaltation that
had transfigured it a moment before was gone.
“You’ll have to promise me,” she said, “about
your mother, you know. I’ll have to be first.”</p>

<p>“Yuh shall be, Emarine.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to promise that if there’s any
knucklin’-down, she’ll do ’t, an’ not me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span></p>

<p>He moved uneasily. “Oh, don’t choo worry,
Emarine. It’ll be all right.”</p>

<p>“Well, I want it settled now. You’ll have to
promise solemn that you’ll stand by ev’rything I
do, an’ let me have things my way. If you don’t,
you can go back the way you come. But I know
you’ll keep your word if you promise.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “I will.”</p>

<p>But he kept his head down and did not promise.</p>

<p>“Well?” she said, and faint as she was, her
voice was like steel.</p>

<p>But still he did not promise.</p>

<p>After a moment she lifted her hand and curved
it about his throat again. He started to draw
away, but almost instantly shuddered closer to
her and fell to kissing the white lace around her
neck.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, coldly, “hurry an’ make
your choice. I hear mother a-comin’.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Emarine!” he burst out, passionately.
“I promise—I promise yuh ev’rything. My
mother’s gittin’ old an’ childish, an’ it ain’t right,
but I can’t give you up ag’in—I <i>can’t</i>! I promise—I
swear!”</p>

<p>Her face took on a tenderness worthy a nobler
victory. She slipped her weak, bare arm up
around him and drew his lips down to hers.</p>

<p>An hour later he walked away from the house,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
the happiest man in Oregon City—or in all Oregon,
for that matter. Mrs. Endey watched him
through the vines. “Well, he’s a-walkin’ knee-deep
in <i>promises</i>,” she reflected, with a comfortable
laugh, as she sent a hot iron hissing over a
newly sprinkled towel. “I guess that mother o’
his’n’ll learn a thing er two if she tries any o’
her back-sass with Emarine.”</p>

<p>Emarine gained strength rapidly. Orville
urged an immediate marriage, but Mrs Endey
objected. “I won’t hear to ’t tell Emarine gits
her spunk back,” she declared. “When she gits
to settin’ her heels down the way she ust to before
she got sick, she can git married. I’ll know then
she’s got her spunk back.”</p>

<p>Toward the last of July Emarine commenced
setting her heels down in the manner approved
by her mother; so, on the first of August they
were married and went to live with Mrs. Palmer.
At the last moment Mrs. Endey whispered grimly—“Now,
you mind you hold your head high.”</p>

<p>“Hunh!” said Emarine. She lifted her chin
so high and so suddenly that her long earrings
sent out flashes in all directions.</p>

<p class="tb">They had been married a full month when Mrs.
Endey went to spend a day at the Palmer’s. She
had a shrewd suspicion that all was not so tranquil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
there as it might be. She walked in unbidden
and unannounced.</p>

<p>It was ten o’clock. The sun shown softly
through the languid purple haze that brooded
upon the valley. Crickets and grasshoppers
crackled through the grasses and ferns. The noble
mountains glimmered mistily in the distance.</p>

<p>Mrs. Palmer was sewing a patch on a tablecloth.
Emarine was polishing silverware. “Oh!”
she said, with a start. “You, is ’t?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Endey, sitting down, “me.
I come to spen’ the day.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t hear yuh knock,” said Mrs. Palmer,
dryly. She was tall and stoop-shouldered. She
had a thin, sour face and white hair. One knew,
only to look at her, that life had given her all its
bitters and but few of its sweets.</p>

<p>“I reckon not,” said Mrs. Endey, “seein’ I
didn’t knock. I don’t knock at my own daughter’s
door. Well, forever! Do you patch table-cloths,
Mis’ Parmer? I never hear tell! I have
see darnt ones, but I never see a patched one.”
She laughed aggravatingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s nothin’,” said Emarine, over her
shoulder, “we have ’em made out o’ flour sacks
here, fer breakfas’.”</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Palmer laughed—a thin, bitter
laugh. Her face was crimson. “Yaas,” she
said, “I use patched table-cloths, an’ table-cloths<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
made out o’ flour sacks; but I never did wear
underclo’s made out o’ unbleached muslin in <i>my</i>
life.”</p>

<p>Then there was a silence. Emarine gave her
mother a look, as much as to say—“What do you
think of that?” Mrs. Endey smiled. “Thank
mercy!” she said. “Dog-days’ll soon be over.
The smoke’s liftin’ a leetle. I guess you an’
Orville’ll git your house painted afore the fall
rain comes on, Emarine? It needs it turrable
bad.”</p>

<p>“They ain’t got the paintin’ of it,” said Mrs.
Palmer, cutting a thread with her teeth. “It
don’t happen to be their house.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s all the same. It’ll git painted if
Emarine wants it sh’u’d. Oh, Emarine! Where’d
you git them funny teaspoons at?”</p>

<p>“They’re Orville’s mother’s.” Emarine gave
a mirthful titter.</p>

<p>“I want to know! Ain’t them funny? Thin’s
no name fer ’m. You’d ought to see the ones
my mother left me, Mis’ Parmer—thick, my!
One ’u’d make the whole dozen o’ you’rn. I’ll
have ’em out an’ ask you over to tea.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heerd about ’em,” said Mrs. Palmer,
with the placidity of a momentary triumph.
“The people your mother worked out fer give
’em to her, didn’t they? My mother got her’n
from her gran’mother. She never worked out.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
She never lived in much style, but she al’ays had
a plenty.”</p>

<p>“My-<i>O</i>!” said Mrs. Endey, scornfully.</p>

<p>“I guess I’d best git the dinner on,” said Emarine.
She pushed the silver to one side with a
clatter. She brought some green corn from the
porch and commenced tearing off the pale emerald
husks.</p>

<p>“D’you want I sh’u’d help shuck it?” said
her mother.</p>

<p>“No; I’m ust to doin’ ’t alone.”</p>

<p>A silence fell upon all three. The fire made a
cheerful noise; the kettle steamed sociably;
some soup-meat, boiling, gave out a savory odor.
Mrs. Endey leaned back comfortably in her rocking-chair.
There was a challenge in the very
fold of her hands in her lap.</p>

<p>Mrs. Palmer sat erect, stiff and thin. The
side of her face was toward Mrs. Endey. She
never moved the fraction of an inch, but watched
her hostilely out of the corner of her eye, like
a hen on the defensive.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Endey who finally renewed hostilities.
“Emarine,” she said, sternly, “what are
you a-doin’? Shortenin’ your biscuits with
<i>lard</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endey sniffed contemptuously. “They
won’t be fit to eat! You feathered your nest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
didn’t you? Fer mercy’s sake! Can’t you buy
butter to shorten your biscuits with? You’ll be
makin’ patata soup next!”</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Palmer stood up. There was a red
spot on each cheek.</p>

<p>“Mis’ Endey,” she said, “if yuh don’t like
the ’comadations in this house, won’t you be so
good ’s to go where they’re better? I must say
I never wear underclo’s made out o’ unbleached
muslin in <i>my</i> life! The hull town’s see ’em on
your clo’s line, an’ tee-hee about it behind your
back. I notice your daughter was mighty
ready to git in here an’ shorten biscuits with lard,
an’ use patched table-cloths, an’—”</p>

<p>“<i>Oh, mother!</i>”</p>

<p>It was her son’s voice. He stood in the door.
His face was white and anxious. He looked at
the two women; then his eyes turned with a
terrified entreaty to Emarine’s face. It was hard
as flint.</p>

<p>“It’s time you come,” she said, briefly.
“Your mother just ordered my mother out o’
doors. Whose house is this?”</p>

<p>He was silent.</p>

<p>“Say, Orville Parmer! whose house is this?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Emarine!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you ‘oh, Emarine’ me! You answer
up!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Emarine, don’t let’s quar’l. We’ve only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
b’en married a month. Let them quar’l, if they
want—”</p>

<p>“You answer up. Whose house is this?”</p>

<p>“It’s mine,” he said in his throat.</p>

<p>“You’rn! Your mother calls it her’n.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is,” he said, with a desperation that
rendered the situation tragic. “Oh, Emarine,
what’s mine’s her’n. Father left it to me, but o’
course he knew it ’u’d be her’n, too. She likes
to call it her’n.”</p>

<p>“Well, she can’t turn my mother out o’ doors.
I’m your wife an’ this is my house, if it’s
you’rn. I guess it ain’t hardly big enough fer
your mother an’ me, too. I reckon one o’ us had
best git out. I don’t care much which, only I
don’t knuckle-down to nobody. I won’t be set
upon by nobody.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Emarine!” There was terror in his
face and voice. He huddled into a chair and
covered his eyes with both hands. Mrs. Palmer,
also, sat down, as if her limbs had suddenly refused
to support her. Mrs. Endey ceased rocking and
sat with folded hands, grimly awaiting developments.</p>

<p>Emarine stood with the backs of her hands on
her hips. She had washed the flour off after putting
the biscuits in the oven, and the palms were
pink and full of soft curves like rose leaves; her
thumbs were turned out at right angles. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
cheeks were crimson, and her eyes were like diamonds.</p>

<p>“One o’ us’ll have to git out,” she said again.
“It’s fer you to say which ’n, Orville Parmer.
I’d just as soon. I won’t upbraid you, ’f you say
me.”</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t upbraid choo, if yuh say me,”
spoke up his mother. Her face was gray. Her
chin quivered, but her voice was firm. “Yuh
speak up, Orville.”</p>

<p>Orville groaned—“Oh, mother! Oh, Emarine!”
His head sunk lower; his breast swelled with
great sobs—the dry, tearing sobs that in a man
are so terrible. “To think that you two women
sh’u’d both love me, an’ then torcher me this
way! Oh, God, what can I do er say?”</p>

<p>Suddenly Emarine uttered a cry, and ran to
him. She tore his hands from his face and cast
herself upon his breast, and with her delicate
arms locked tight about his throat, set her warm,
throbbing lips upon his eyes, his brow, his mouth,
in deep, compelling kisses. “I’m your wife!
I’m your wife! I’m your wife!” she panted.
“You promised ev’rything to get me to marry
you! Can you turn me out now, an’ make me a
laughin’-stawk fer the town? Can you give <i>me</i>
up? You love me, an’ I love you! Let me show
you how I love you—”</p>

<p>She felt his arms close around her convulsively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span></p>

<p>Then his mother arose and came to them, and
laid her wrinkled, shaking hand on his shoulder.
“My son,” she said, “let <i>me</i> show yuh how <i>I</i>
love yuh. I’m your mother. I’ve worked fer
yuh, an’ done fer yuh all your life, but the time’s
come fer me to take a back seat. Its be’n hard—it’s
be’n offul hard—an’ I guess I’ve be’n mean
an’ hateful to Emarine—but it’s be’n hard.
Yuh keep Emarine, an’ I’ll go. Yuh want her
an’ I want choo to be happy. Don’t choo worry
about me—I’ll git along all right. Yuh won’t
have to decide—I’ll go of myself. That’s the
way <i>mothers</i> love, my son!”</p>

<p>She walked steadily out of the kitchen; and
though her head was shaking, it was carried
high.</p>

<h4>PART III</h4>

<p>It was the day before Christmas—an Oregon
Christmas. It had rained mistily at dawn; but
at ten o’clock the clouds had parted and moved
away reluctantly. There was a blue and dazzling
sky overhead. The rain-drops still sparkled on
the windows and on the green grass, and the last
roses and chrysanthemums hung their beautiful
heads heavily beneath them; but there was to be
no more rain. Oregon City’s mighty barometer—the
Falls of the Willamette—was declaring to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
people by her softened roar that the morrow was
to be fair.</p>

<p>Mrs. Orville Palmer was in the large kitchen
making preparations for the Christmas dinner.
She was a picture of dainty loveliness in a lavender
gingham dress, made with a full skirt and a
shirred waist and big leg-o’-mutton sleeves. A
white apron was tied neatly around her waist.</p>

<p>Her husband came in, and paused to put his
arm around her and kiss her. She was stirring
something on the stove, holding her dress aside
with one hand.</p>

<p>“It’s goin’ to be a fine Christmas, Emarine,”
he said, and sighed unconsciously. There was a
wistful and careworn look on his face.</p>

<p>“Beautiful!” said Emarine, vivaciously. “Goin’
down-town, Orville?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Want anything?”</p>

<p>“Why, the cranberries ain’t come yet. I’m
so uneasy about ’em. They’d ought to ’a’ b’en
stooed long ago. I like ’em cooked down an’
strained to a jell. I don’t see what ails them
groc’rymen! Sh’u’d think they c’u’d get around
some time before doomsday! Then, I want—here,
you’d best set it down.” She took a pencil and
a slip of paper from a shelf over the table and
gave them to him. “Now, let me see.” She
commenced stirring again, with two little wrinkles
between her brows. “A ha’f a pound o’ citron; a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
ha’f a pound o’ candied peel; two pounds o’
cur’nts; two pounds o’ raisins—git ’em stunned,
Orville; a pound o’ sooet—make ’em give you
some that ain’t all strings! A box o’ Norther’
Spy apples; a ha’f a dozen lemons; four-bits’
worth o’ walnuts or a’monds, whichever’s freshest;
a pint o’ Puget Sound oysters fer the dressin’,
an’ a bunch o’ cel’ry. You stop by an’ see about
the turkey, Orville; an’ I wish you’d run in ’s
you go by mother’s an’ tell her to come up as
soon as she can. She’d ought to be here now.”</p>

<p>Her husband smiled as he finished the list.
“You’re a wonderful housekeeper, Emarine,” he
said.</p>

<p>Then his face grew grave. “Got a present fer
your mother yet, Emarine?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, long ago. I got ’er a black shawl
down t’ Charman’s. She’s b’en wantin’ one.”</p>

<p>He shuffled his feet about a little. “Unh-hunh.
Yuh—that is—I reckon yuh ain’t picked
out any present fer—fer my mother, have yuh,
Emarine?”</p>

<p>“No,” she replied, with cold distinctness. “I
ain’t.”</p>

<p>There was a silence. Emarine stirred briskly.
The lines grew deeper between her brows. Two
red spots came into her cheeks. “I hope the rain
ain’t spoilt the chrysyanthums,” she said then,
with an air of ridding herself of a disagreeable
subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span></p>

<p>Orville made no answer. He moved his feet
again uneasily. Presently he said: “I expect
my mother needs a black shawl, too. Seemed to
me her’n looked kind o’ rusty at church Sunday.
Notice it, Emarine?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Emarine.</p>

<p>“Seemed to me she was gittin’ to look offul
old. Emarine”—his voice broke; he came a step
nearer—“it’ll be the first Christmas dinner I ever
eat without my mother.”</p>

<p>She drew back and looked at him. He knew
the look that flashed into her eyes, and shrank
from it.</p>

<p>“You don’t have to eat this ’n’ without ’er,
Orville Parmer! You go an’ eat your dinner
with your mother, ’f you want! I can get along
alone. Are you goin’ to order them things? If
you ain’t, just say so, an’ I’ll go an’ do ’t myself!”</p>

<p>He put on his hat and went without a word.</p>

<p>Mrs. Palmer took the saucepan from the stove
and set it on the hearth. Then she sat down and
leaned her cheek in the palm of her hand, and
looked steadily out of the window. Her eyelids
trembled closer together. Her eyes held a far-sighted
look. She saw a picture; but it was not
the picture of the blue reaches of sky, and the
green valley cleft by its silver-blue river. She
saw a kitchen, shabby, compared to her own,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
scantily furnished, and in it an old, white-haired
woman sitting down to eat her Christmas dinner
alone.</p>

<p>After a while she arose with an impatient sigh.
“Well, I can’t help it!” she exclaimed. “If I
knuckled-down to her this time, I’d have to do ’t
ag’in. She might just as well get ust to ’t, first
as last. I wish she hadn’t got to lookin’ so old
an’ pitiful, though, a-settin’ there in front o’ us
in church Sunday after Sunday. The cords
stand out in her neck like well-rope, an’ her chin
keeps a-quiv’rin’ so I can see Orville a-watchin’
her——”</p>

<p>The door opened suddenly and her mother entered.
She was bristling with curiosity. “Say,
Emarine!” She lowered her voice, although
there was no one to hear. “Where d’ you s’pose
the undertaker’s a-goin’ up by here? Have you
hear of anybody——”</p>

<p>“No,” said Emarine. “Did Orville stop by
an’ tell you to hurry up?”</p>

<p>“Yes. What’s the matter of him? Is he
sick?”</p>

<p>“Not as I know of. Why?”</p>

<p>“He looks so. Oh, I wonder if it’s one o’ the
Peterson childern where the undertaker’s a-goin’!
They’ve all got the quinsy sore throat.”</p>

<p>“How does he look? I don’t see ’s he looks
so turrable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span></p>

<p>“Why, Emarine Parmer! Ev’rybody in town
says he looks <i>so</i>! I only hope they don’t know
what ails him!”</p>

<p>“What <i>does</i> ail him?” cried out Emarine,
fiercely. “What are you hintin’ at?”</p>

<p>“Well, if you don’t know what ails him,
you’d ort to; so I’ll tell you. He’s dyin’ by
inches ever sence you turned his mother out o’
doors.”</p>

<p>Emarine turned white. Sheet lightning played
in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’d ought to talk about my turnin’
her out!” she burst out, furiously. “After you
a-settin’ here a-quar’l’n’ with her in this very
kitchen, an’ eggin’ me on! Wa’n’t she goin’ to
turn you out o’ your own daughter’s home?
Wa’n’t that what I turned her out fer? I didn’t
turn her out, anyhow! I only told Orville this
house wa’n’t big enough fer his mother an’ me,
an’ that neither o’ us ’u’d knuckle-down, so he’d
best take his choice. You’d ought to talk!”</p>

<p>“Well, if I egged you on, I’m sorry fer ’t,”
said Mrs. Endey, solemnly. “Ever sence that fit
o’ sickness I had a month ago, I’ve feel kind o’
old an’ no account myself, as if I’d like to let all
holts go, an’ just rest. I don’t spunk up like I
ust to. No, he didn’t go to Peterson’s—he’s
gawn right on. My land! I wonder ’f it ain’t
old gran’ma Eliot; she had a bad spell—no, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
didn’t turn that corner. I can’t think where he’s
goin’ to!”</p>

<p>She sat down with a sigh of defeat.</p>

<p>A smile glimmered palely across Emarine’s
face and was gone. “Maybe if you’d go up in
the antic you could see better,” she suggested,
dryly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Emarine, here comes old gran’ma Eliot
herself! Run an’ open the door fer ’er. She’s
limpin’ worse ’n usual.”</p>

<p>Emarine flew to the door. Grandma Eliot was
one of the few people she loved. She was large
and motherly. She wore a black dress and shawl
and a funny bonnet, with a frill of white lace
around her brow.</p>

<p>Emarine’s face softened when she kissed her.
“I’m so glad to see you,” she said, and her voice
was tender.</p>

<p>Even Mrs. Endey’s face underwent a change.
Usually it wore a look of doubt, if not of positive
suspicion, but now it fairly beamed. She shook
hands cordially with the guest and led her to a
comfortable chair.</p>

<p>“I know your rheumatiz is worse,” she said,
cheerfully, “because you’re limpin’ so. Oh, did
you see the undertaker go up by here? We can’t
think where he’s goin’ to. D’ you happen to
know?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t; an’ I don’t want to, neither.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
Mrs. Eliot laughed comfortably. “Mis’ Endey,
you don’t ketch me foolin’ with undertakers till
I have to.” She sat down and removed her
black cotton gloves. “I’m gettin’ to that age
when I don’t care much where undertakers go to
so long ’s they let <i>me</i> alone. Fixin’ fer Christmas
dinner, Emarine dear?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” said Emarine in her very gentlest
tone. Her mother had never said “dear”
to her, and the sound of it on this old lady’s lips
was sweet. “Won’t you come an’ take dinner
with us?”</p>

<p>The old lady laughed merrily. “Oh, dearie
me, dearie me! You don’t guess my son’s folks
could spare me now, do you? I spend ev’ry
Christmas there. They most carry me on two
chips. My son’s wife, Sidonie, she nearly runs
her feet off waitin’ on me. She can’t do enough
fer me. My, Mrs. Endey, you don’t know what
a comfort a daughter-in-law is when you get old
an’ feeble!”</p>

<p>Emarine’s face turned red. She went to the
table and stood with her back to the older woman;
but her mother’s sharp eyes observed that her ears
grew scarlet.</p>

<p>“An’ I never will,” said Mrs. Endey, grimly.</p>

<p>“You’ve got a son-in-law, though, who’s worth
a whole townful of most son-in-laws. He was
such a good son, too; jest worshipped his mother;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
couldn’t bear her out o’ his sight. He humored
her high an’ low. That’s jest the way Sidonie
does with me. I’m gettin’ cranky ’s I get older,
an’ sometimes I’m reel cross an’ sassy to her; but
she jest laffs at me, an’ then comes an’ kisses me,
an’ I’m all right ag’in. It’s a blessin’ right from
God to have a daughter-in-law like that.”</p>

<p>The knife in Emarine’s hand slipped, and she
uttered a little cry.</p>

<p>“Hurt you?” demanded her mother, sternly.</p>

<p>Emarine was silent, and did not turn.</p>

<p>“Cut you, Emarine? Why don’t you answer
me? Aigh?”</p>

<p>“A little,” said Emarine. She went into the
pantry, and presently returned with a narrow strip
of muslin which she wound around her finger.</p>

<p>“Well, I never see! You never will learn any
gumption! Why don’t you look what you’re
about? Now, go around Christmas with your
finger all tied up!”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’ll be all right by to-morrow,” said
Mrs. Eliot, cheerfully. “Won’t it, Emarine?
Never cry over spilt milk, Mrs. Endey; it makes
a body get wrinkles too fast. O’ course Orville’s
mother’s comin’ to take dinner’ with you, Emarine.”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” exclaimed Emarine, in a sudden
flutter. “I don’t see why them cranberries don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
come! I told Orville to hurry ’em up. I’d best
make the floatin’ island while I wait.”</p>

<p>“I stopped at Orville’s mother’s as I came
along.”</p>

<p>“How?” Emarine turned in a startled way
from the table.</p>

<p>“I say, I stopped at Orville’s mother’s as I come
along, Emarine.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“She well?” asked Mrs. Endey.</p>

<p>“No, she ain’t; shakin’ like she had the Saint
Vitus dance. She’s failed harrable lately. She’d
b’en cryin’; her eyes was all swelled up.”</p>

<p>There was quite a silence. Then Mrs. Endey
said—“What she b’en cryin’ about?”</p>

<p>“Why, when I asked her she jest laffed kind o’
pitiful, an’ said: ‘Oh, only my tomfoolishness,
o’ course.’ Said she always got to thinkin’ about
other Christmases. But I cheered her up. I
told her what a good time I always had at my
son’s, and how Sidonie jest couldn’t do enough
fer me. An’ I told her to think what a nice time
she’d have here ’t Emarine’s to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endey smiled. “What she say to that?”</p>

<p>“She didn’t say much. I could see she was
thankful, though, she had a son’s to go to. She
said she pitied all poor wretches that had to set
out their Christmas alone. Poor old lady! she
ain’t got much spunk left. She’s all broke down.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
But I cheered her up some. Sech a <i>wishful</i> look
took holt o’ her when I pictchered her dinner over
here at Emarine’s. I can’t seem to forget it.
Goodness! I must go. I’m on my way to Sidonie’s,
an’ she’ll be comin’ after me if I ain’t on
time.”</p>

<p>When Mrs. Eliot had gone limping down the
path, Mrs. Endey said: “You got your front
room red up, Emarine?”</p>

<p>“No; I ain’t had time to red up anything.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll do it. Where’s your duster at?”</p>

<p>“Behind the org’n. You can get out the wax
cross again. Mis’ Dillon was here with all her
childern, an’ I had to hide up ev’rything. I
never see childern like her’n. She lets ’em handle
things so!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Endey went into the “front room” and
began to dust the organ. She was something of
a diplomat, and she wished to be alone for a few
minutes. “You have to manage Emarine by
contrairies,” she reflected. It did not occur to
her that this was a family trait. “I’m offul sorry
I ever egged her on to turnin’ Orville’s mother
out o’ doors, but who’d ’a’ thought it ’u’d break
her down so? She ain’t told a soul either. I
reckoned she’d talk somethin’ offul about us, but
she ain’t told a soul. She’s kep’ a stiff upper lip
an’ told folks she al’ays expected to live alone when
Orville got married. Emarine’s all worked up.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
I believe the Lord hisself must ’a’ sent gran’ma
Eliot here to talk like an angel unawares. I bet
she’d go an’ ask Mis’ Parmer over here to dinner
if she wa’n’t afraid I’d laff at her fer knucklin’-down.
I’ll have to aggravate her.”</p>

<p>She finished dusting, and returned to the
kitchen. “I wonder what gran’ma Eliot ’u’d
say if she knew you’d turned Orville’s mother
out, Emarine?”</p>

<p>There was no reply. Emarine was at the table
mixing the plum pudding. Her back was to her
mother.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean what I said about bein’ sorry
I egged you on, Emarine. I’m glad you turned
her out. She’d <i>ort</i> to be turned out.”</p>

<p>Emarine put a handful of floured raisins into
the mixture and stirred it all together briskly.</p>

<p>“Gran’ma Eliot can go talkin’ about her daughter-in-law
Sidonie all she wants, Emarine. You
keep a stiff upper lip.”</p>

<p>“I can ’tend to my own affairs,” said Emarine,
fiercely.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t flare up so. Here comes Orville.
Land, but he does look peakid!”</p>

<p class="tb">After supper, when her mother had gone home
for the night, Emarine put on her hat and shawl.</p>

<p>Her husband was sitting by the fireplace, looking
thoughtfully at the bed of coals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span></p>

<p>“I’m goin’ out,” she said, briefly. “You keep
the fire up.”</p>

<p>“Why, Emarine, its dark. Don’t choo want I
sh’u’d go along?”</p>

<p>“No; you keep the fire up.”</p>

<p>He looked at her anxiously, but he knew from
the way she set her heels down that remonstrance
would be useless.</p>

<p>“Don’t stay long,” he said, in a tone of habitual
tenderness. He loved her passionately, in
spite of the lasting hurt she had given him when
she parted him from his mother. It was a hurt
that had sunk deeper than even he realized. It
lay heavy on his heart day and night. It took
the blue out of the sky, and the green out of the
grass, and the gold out of the sunlight; it took
the exaltation and the rapture out of his tenderest
moments of love.</p>

<p>He never reproached her, he never really blamed
her; certainly he never pitied himself. But he carried
a heavy heart around with him, and his few
smiles were joyless things.</p>

<p>For the trouble he blamed only himself. He had
promised Emarine solemnly before he married her
that if there were any “knuckling-down” to be
done, his mother should be the one to do it. He
had made the promise deliberately, and he could
no more have broken it than he could have
changed the color of his eyes. When bitter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
feeling arises between two relatives by marriage,
it is the one who stands between them—the one
who is bound by the tenderest ties to both—who
has the real suffering to bear, who is torn and
tortured until life holds nothing worth the having.</p>

<p>Orville Palmer was the one who stood between.
He had built his own cross, and he took it up and
bore it without a word.</p>

<p>Emarine hurried through the early winter dark
until she came to the small and poor house where
her husband’s mother lived. It was off the main-traveled
street.</p>

<p>There was a dim light in the kitchen; the curtain
had not been drawn. Emarine paused and
looked in. The sash was lifted six inches, for the
night was warm, and the sound of voices came to
her at once. Mrs. Palmer had company.</p>

<p>“It’s Miss Presly,” said Emarine, resentfully,
under her breath. “Old gossip!”</p>

<p>“—goin’ to have a fine dinner, I hear,” Miss
Presly was saying. “Turkey with oyster dressin’,
an’ cranberries, an’ mince an’ pun’kin pie, an’ reel
plum puddin’ with brandy poured over ’t an’ set
afire, an’ wine dip, an’ nuts, an’ raisins, an’ wine
itself to wind up on. Emarine’s a fine cook. She
knows how to get up a dinner that makes your
mouth water to think about. You goin’ to have a
spread, Mis’ Parmer?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span></p>

<p>“Not much of a one,” said Orville’s mother.
“I expected to, but I c’u’dn’t get them fall patatas
sold off. I’ll have to keep ’em till spring to
git any kind o’ price. I don’t care much about
Christmas, though”—her chin was trembling,
but she lifted it high. “It’s silly for anybody
but childern to build so much on Christmas.”</p>

<p>Emarine opened the door and walked in. Mrs.
Palmer arose slowly, grasping the back of her
chair. “Orville’s dead?” she said, solemnly.</p>

<p>Emarine laughed, but there was the tenderness
of near tears in her voice. “Oh, my, no!” she
said, sitting down. “I run over to ask you to
come to Christmas dinner. I was too busy all
day to come sooner. I’m goin’ to have a great
dinner, an’ I’ve cooked ev’ry single thing of it
myself! I want to show you what a fine Christmas
dinner your daughter-’n-law can get up.
Dinner’s at two, an’ I want you to come at eleven.
Will you?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Palmer had sat down, weakly. Trembling
was not the word to describe the feeling that
had taken possession of her. She was shivering.
She wanted to fall down on her knees and put her
arms around her son’s wife, and sob out all her
loneliness and heartache. But life is a stage;
and Miss Presly was an audience not to be ignored.
So Mrs. Palmer said: “Well, I’ll be reel glad
to come, Emarine. It’s offul kind o’ yuh to think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
of ’t. It ’u’d ’a’ be’n lonesome eatin’ here all by
myself, I expect.”</p>

<p>Emarine stood up. Her heart was like a thistle-down.
Her eyes were shining. “All right,”
she said; “an’ I want that you sh’u’d come just
at eleven. I must run right back now. Good-night.”</p>

<p>“Well, I declare!” said Miss Presly. “That
girl gits prettier ev’ry day o’ her life. Why, she
just looked full o’ <i>glame</i> to-night!”</p>

<p class="tb">Orville was not at home when his mother arrived
in her rusty best dress and shawl. Mrs.
Endey saw her coming. She gasped out, “Why,
good grieve! Here’s Mis’ Parmer, Emarine!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” said Emarine, calmly. “I ast
her to dinner.”</p>

<p>She opened the door, and shook hands with her
mother-in-law, giving her mother a look of defiance
that almost upset that lady’s gravity.</p>

<p>“You set right down, Mother Parmer, an’ let
me take your things. Orville don’t know you’re
comin’, an’ I just want to see his face when he
comes in. Here’s a new black shawl fer your
Christmas. I got mother one just like it. See
what nice long fringe it’s got. Oh, my, don’t go
to cryin’! Here comes Orville.”</p>

<p>She stepped aside quickly. When her husband<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
entered his eyes fell instantly on his mother, weeping
childishly over the new shawl. She was in
the old splint rocking-chair with the high back.
“<i>Mother!</i>” he cried; then he gave a frightened,
tortured glance at his wife. Emarine smiled at
him, but it was through tears.</p>

<p>“Emarine ast me, Orville—she ast me to dinner
o’ herself! An’ she give me this shawl. I’m—cryin’—fer—joy——”</p>

<p>“I ast her to dinner,” said Emarine, “but she
ain’t ever goin’ back again. She’s goin’ to <i>stay</i>.
I expect we’ve both had enough of a lesson to
do us.”</p>

<p>Orville did not speak. He fell on his knees
and laid his head, like a boy, in his mother’s lap,
and reached one strong but trembling arm up to
his wife’s waist, drawing her down to him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Endey got up and went to rattling things
around on the table vigorously. “Well, I never
see sech a pack o’ loonatics!” she exclaimed.
“Go an’ burn all your Christmas dinner up, if I
don’t look after it! Turncoats! I expect they’ll
both be fallin’ over theirselves to knuckle-down
to each other from now on! I never see!”</p>

<p>But there was something in her eyes, too, that
made them beautiful.</p>

<h3>THE CUTTIN’-OUT OF BART WINN</h3>

<p>“Lavin-ee!”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Vaiden came to the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p>“You up there?” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes, maw. What you want?”</p>

<p>“Somebody’s comin’,” said Mrs. Vaiden, lowering
her voice to a tone of important mystery.</p>

<p>“I guess not here,” said Lavinia, lightly.
She sat down on the top step and smiled at her
mother.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is here, too,” retorted Mrs. Vaiden,
with some irritation. “If you couldn’t conterdict
a body ’t wouldn’t be you! You’re just like
your paw!” She paused, and then added: “It’s
a man a-foot. He’s comin’ up the path slow,
a-stoppin’ to look at the flowers.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s the minister,” said the girl, still
regarding her mother with a good-natured, teasing
smile.</p>

<p>“No, it ain’t the minister, either. As if I
didn’t know the minister when I see him! You
do aggravate me so! It’s a young fello’, an’ he’s
all dressed up. You’ll have to go to the door.”</p>

<p>“Oh, maw!” cried Lavinia, reproachfully. “I
just can’t! In this short dress?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span></p>

<p>She stood up, with a look of dismay, and began
pulling nervously at her fresh gingham skirt.
It was short, showing very prettily-arched insteps
and delicate ankles.</p>

<p>“Well, you just can, an’ haf to,” said Mrs.
Vaiden, shortly. “I’ve told you often enough
to put a ruffle on the bottom o’ that dress, an’
I’m glad you’re caught. Mebbe you’ll do’s I
tell you after this—”</p>

<p>She started guiltily as a loud rap sounded upon
the door behind her, and began to tiptoe heavily
down the hall toward the kitchen. The girl
looked after her in mingled amusement and chagrin.
Then she leaned forward slightly, drawing
the skirt back closely on both sides, and looked at
her feet, with her head turned on one side like a
bird. When the cessation of her mother’s labored
breathing announced silently that she had reached
the kitchen in safety, Lavinia shrugged her beautiful
shoulders—which no gown could conceal—and
opened the door. A young man in a light
traveling-suit stood before her. In his hand was
a bunch of her own sweet-peas.</p>

<p>At sight of her he whisked off his hat in a
way that brought a lovely color to her face and
throat. For a little while it seemed as if he were
not going to say or do anything but just look at
her. She was well worth looking at. She had
the rare beauty of velvet eyes of a reddish-brown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
color, hair wavy and brown, with red glints in it,
and a clear complexion, unfreckled and of exquisite
coloring.</p>

<p>Lavinia’s eyes went to the sweet-peas, and then,
with a deeper blush under them, to his face.</p>

<p>“Won’t you come in?” she said.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, if you’ll let me.” The young
man smiled, and Lavinia found her lips and eyes
responding, in all the lightness of youth and a
clear conscience.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t help taking some of your sweet-peas,”
he said, following her into the parlor. It
was a large, solemn-looking room. The blinds
were lowered over the windows, but the girl raised
one slightly, letting a splash of pale autumnal sunshine
flicker across the hit-and-miss rag carpet.
There was an organ in one corner and a hair-cloth
sofa in another. Eight slender-legged
hair-cloth chairs were placed at severely equal
distances around the room, their backs resting
firmly against the walls. All tipped forward
slightly, their front legs being somewhat shorter
than the others. On the back of each was a
small, square crocheted tidy. There were some
family portraits on the walls, in oval gilt frames;
and there was a large picture of George Washington
and family, on their stateliest behavior;
another, named in large letters “The Journey of
Life,” of an uncommonly roomy row-boat containing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
at least a dozen persons, who were supposed
to represent all ages from the cradle to
the grave; in the wide, white margin beneath
this picture were two verses of beautiful, descriptive
poetry, and in one corner appeared, with
apparent irrelevancy, the name of an illustrated
newspaper. There was also a chromo of a scantily-attired
woman clinging to a cross which was set
in the midst of dashing sea-waves; and there
was a cheerful photograph, in a black cloth frame,
of flowers—made into harps, crosses, anchors
and hearts—which had been sent at some time
of bereavement by sympathetic but misguided
friends. A marble-topped centre-table held a
large plush album, a scrap book, a book of
autographs, a lamp with a pale-green shade, and
a glass case containing a feather-wreath.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ve got lots of sweet-peas,” said
Lavinia, adjusting the blind carefully. Then she
looked at him.</p>

<p>“May I see Mrs. Vaiden?” he asked, easily.</p>

<p>“She’s—busy,” said Lavinia, with a look of
embarrassment. “But I’ll see—”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t,” interrupted the young man
lightly. “They told me at the postoffice she took
boarders sometimes, and I came to see if there
was a chance for me.” He handed a card to the
girl with an air of not knowing that he was doing
it. Her very eyelids seemed to blush as she looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
at it and read the name—Mr. C. Daun Diller.
“I am writing up the Puget Sound country for a
New York paper, and I should like to make my
headquarters here at Whatcom, but I can’t stand
the hotels in your new towns. It’s the most amazing
thing!” he went on, smiling at her as she
stood twisting the card in her fingers, not knowing
exactly what to do with it. “You go to
sleep at night in a Puget Sound village with the
fronts of the stores painted green, blue and red,
spasmodic patches of sidewalk here and there,
dust ankle deep, and no street-lights—and you
wake in the morning in a <i>city</i>! A city with fine
stone blocks and residences, stone pavements,
electric lights and railways, gas, splendid water-works,”—he
was checking off now, excitedly, on
his fingers,—“sewerage, big mills, factories, canneries,
public schools that would make the East
stare, churches, libraries”—he stopped abruptly,
and, dropping his arms limply to his sides, added—“and
not a hotel! Not a comfortable bed or
a good meal to be had for love or money!”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so,” said Lavinia, reluctantly.
“But you can’t expect us to get everything all
at onct. Why, Whatcom’s boom only started
in six months ago.”</p>

<p>Mr. C. Daun Diller looked amused. “Oh, if
it were this town only,” he said, sitting down on
one of the hair-cloth chairs and feeling himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
slide gently forward, “I shouldn’t have mentioned
it. But the truth is, there are only three decent
hotels in the whole Puget Sound country. But
I know”—here he smiled at her again—“that
it’s not safe to breathe a word against Puget Sound
to a Puget-Sounder.”</p>

<p>“No, it ain’t,” said the girl, responding to the
smile and the respectfully bantering tone. Then
she moved to the door. “Well, I’ll see what
maw says to it,” she said, and vanished.</p>

<p>Mr. C. Daun Diller stood up and pushed his
hands down into his pockets, whistling softly.
He walked over to the organ and looked at the
music. There were three large books: “The
Home Circle,” “The Golden Chord,” and “The
Family Treasure;” a “simplified” copy of “The
Maiden’s Prayer,” and a book of “Gospel
Songs.”</p>

<p>The young man smiled.</p>

<p>“All the same,” he said, as if in answer to a
disparaging remark made by some one else,
“she’s about the handsomest girl I ever saw.
I’m getting right down anxious to see myself
what ‘maw’ will ‘say to it.’”</p>

<p>After a long while Mrs. Vaiden appeared in a
crisply-starched gingham dress and a company
manner—both of which had been freshly put on
for the occasion. Mr. Diller found her rather
painfully polite, and he began to wonder, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
paying his first week’s board, whether he could
endure two or three months of her; but he was
quite, quite sure that he could endure a full year
of the daughter.</p>

<p>A couple of evenings later he was sitting by
the window in his quaint but exquisitely neat
room, writing, when a light rap came upon his
door. Upon opening it he found Lavinia standing,
bashfully, a few steps away. There was a
picturesque, broad-brimmed hat set coquettishly
on her splendid hair.</p>

<p>“Maw wanted I sh’u’d ask you if you’d like
to see an Indian canoe-race,” she said.</p>

<p>“<i>Would</i> I?” he ejaculated, getting into a great
excitement at once. “Well, I should say so!
Awfully good of your mother to think—but where
is it—when is it? How can I see it?”</p>

<p>“It’s down by the viaduck—right now,” said
Lavinia. Then she added, shyly, pretending to
be deeply engrossed with her glove: “I’m just
goin’.”</p>

<p>“Oh, are you?” said Diller, seizing his hat
and stick and coming eagerly out to her. “And
may I go with you? Will you take me in hand?
I haven’t the ghost of an idea where the viaduct
is.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’ll show you,” she said, with a glad
little laugh, and they went swiftly down the
stairs and out into the sweet evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span></p>

<p>“You know,” she said, as he opened the gate
for her with a deference to which she was not accustomed,
and which gave her a thrill of innocent
exultation, “the Alaska Indians are just comin’
back from hop-pickin’ down around Puyallup an’
Yakima an’ Seattle, an’ they alwus stop here an’
have races with the Lummies an’ the Nooksacks.”</p>

<p>Mr. Diller drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” he said, “I wouldn’t have
missed this for anything—not for anything I can
think of. And yet I should if it hadn’t been
for”—he hesitated, and then added—“your
mother.” They looked into each other’s eyes and
laughed, very foolishly and happily.</p>

<p>The sun was setting—moving slowly, scarlet
and of dazzling brilliancy, down the western sky,
which shaded rapidly from pale blue to salmon, and
from salmon to palest pea-green. Beneath, superbly
motionless, at full tide, the sound stretched
mile on mile away to Lummi peninsula, whose
hills the sun now touched—every fir-tree on those
noble crests standing out against that burnished
background. A broad, unbroken path of gold
stretched from shore to shore. Some sea-gulls
were circling in endless, silvery rings through the
amethystine haze between sea and sky. The old,
rotten pier running a mile out to sea shone like a
strip of gold above the deep blue water. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
crowded with people, indifferent to danger in their
eagerness to see the races. Indeed, there seemed
to be people everywhere; on the high banks, the
piers, and the mills scattered over the tide-flats,
and out in row boats. Two brass bands were
playing stirring strains alternately. There was
much excitement—much shouting, hurrying, running.
The crowd kept swaying from the viaduct
over to the pier, and from the pier back to the
viaduct. Nobody seemed to be quite sure where
the start would be; even the three judges, when
asked, yelled back, as they clambered down to
their row-boat: “We don’t know. Wait and
see!”</p>

<p>“What accommodating persons,” said Mr.
Diller, cheerfully. “Shall we go over to the
pier? The tide seems to be running that way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the tide’s not running now,” said Lavinia.
“It’s full.”</p>

<p>Diller looked amused. “I meant the people,”
he said.</p>

<p>The girl laughed and looked around on the
pushing crowd. “I guess we’d best stop right
here on the viaduck; here’s just where they
started last year an’ the year before. Oh, see,
here’s the Alaskas camped pretty near under us!”</p>

<p>As she lifted her voice a little Diller saw a
young man standing near start and turn toward
her with a glad look of recognition; but at once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
his glance rested on Diller, and his expression
changed to a kind of puzzled bewilderment. The
girl was leaning over the railing and did not see
him, but he never took his eyes away from her
and Diller.</p>

<p>There was a long wait, but the crowd did not
lose its patience or its good humor. There was
considerable betting going on, and there was the
same exciting uncertainty about the start. The
sun went down and a bank of apricot-colored
clouds piled low over the snow crest of Mount
Baker in the East. The pier darkened and the
path of gold faded, but splashes of scarlet still
lingered on the blue water. A chill, sweet wind
started up suddenly, and some of the girl’s bronze
curls got loose about her white temples. Diller
put her wrap around her carefully, and she smiled
up at him deliciously. Then she cried out,
“Oh, they’re gettin’ into the boat! They’re
goin’ to start. Oh, I’m so glad!” and struck her
two hands together gleefully, like a child.</p>

<p>The long, narrow, richly-painted and carven
canoe slid down gracefully into the water. Eleven
tall, supple Alaskan Indians, bare to the waist,
leaped lightly to their places. They sat erect,
close to the sides of the boat, holding their short
paddles perpendicularly. At a signal the paddles
shot straight down into the water, and, with a
swift, magnificent straining and swelling of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
muscles in the powerful bronze arms and bodies,
were pushed backward and withdrawn in lightning
strokes. The canoe flashed under the viaduct
and appeared on the other side, and a great
shout belched from thousands of throats. From
camping-places farther up the shore the other
boats darted out into the water and headed for
the viaduct.</p>

<p>“Oh, good! good!” cried Lavinia in a very
ecstasy of excitement. “They’re goin’ to start
right under us. We’re just in <i>the</i> place!”</p>

<p>“Twenty dollars on the Nooksacks!” yelled a
blear-eyed man in a carriage. “Twenty! Twenty
ag’inst ten on the Nooksacks!”</p>

<p>The band burst into “Hail, Columbia!” with
beautiful irrelevancy. The crowd came surging
back from the pier. Diller was excited, too. His
face was flushed and he was breathing heavily.
“Who’ll you bet on?” he asked, laughing, and
thinking, even at that moment, how ravishingly
lovely she was with that glow on her face and
the loose curls blowing about her face and throat.</p>

<p>“Oh, the <i>Alaskas</i>!” cried the girl, striking little
blows of impatience on the railing with her
soft fists. “They’re so tall an’ fine-lookin’!
They’re so strong an’ grand! Look at their
muscles—just like ropes! Oh, I’ll bet on the
Alaskas! I <i>love</i> tall men!”</p>

<p>“Do you?” said Diller. “I’m tall.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span></p>

<p>They looked into each other’s eyes again and
laughed. Then a voice spoke over their shoulders—a
kind, patient voice. “Oh, Laviny,” it
said; “I wouldn’t bet if I was you.”</p>

<p>Lavinia gave a little scream. Both turned instantly.
The young man who had been watching
them stood close to them. He wore working-clothes—a
flannel shirt and cheap-faded trousers
and coat. He had a good, strong, honest face,
and there was a tenderness in the look he bent on
the girl that struck Diller as being almost pathetic.</p>

<p>The glow in Lavinia’s face turned to the scarlet
of the sunset.</p>

<p>“<i>Oh!</i>” she said, embarrassedly. “That you,
Bart? I didn’t know you was back.”</p>

<p>“I just got back,” he replied, briefly. “I got
to go back again in the mornin’. I was just on
my way up to your house. I guess I’ll go on.
I’m tired, an’ I’ve seen lots o’ c’noe races.” He
looked at her wistfully.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, after a moment’s hesitation.
“You go on up, then. Maw an’ paw’s at home,
an’ I’ll come as soon ’s the race ’s over.”</p>

<p>“All right,” he said, with a little drop in his
voice, and walked away.</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>dear</i>!” cried Lavinia. “We’re missin’
the start, ain’t we?”</p>

<p>The canoes were lying side by side, waiting for
the signal. Every Indian was bent forward,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
holding his paddle suspended above the water in
both hands. There was what might be termed a
rigid suppleness in the attitude. The dark outlines
of the paddles showed clearly in the water,
which had turned yellow as brass. Suddenly the
band ceased playing and the signal rang across
the sunset. Thirty-three paddles shot into the
water, working with the swift regularity of piston-rods
in powerful engines. The crowds cheered
and yelled. The canoes did not flash or glide
now, but literally plowed and plunged through
the water, which boiled and seethed behind them
in white, bubbled foam that at times completely
hid the bronze figures from sight. There was no
shouting now, but tense, breathless excitement.
People clung motionless, in dangerous places and
stared with straining eyes, under bent brows, after
the leaping canoes. The betting had been high.
The fierce, rhythmic strokes of the paddles made a
noise that was like the rapid pumping of a great
ram. To Diller, who stood, pale, with compressed
lips, it sounded like the frantic heart-beat of
a nation in passionate riot. Mingled with it was
a noise that, once heard, cannot be forgotten—a
weird, guttural chanting on one tone, that yet
seemed to hold a windy, musical note; a sound,
regular, and rhythmic as the paddle-strokes, that
came from deep in the breasts of the rigidly swaying
Indians and found utterance through locked
teeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span></p>

<p>A mile out a railroad crossed the tide-lands,
and this was the turning point. The Nooksacks
made it first, closely followed by the Alaskans,
and then, amid wild cheering, the three canoes
headed for the viaduct. Faster and faster worked
those powerful arms; the paddles whizzed more
fiercely through the air; the water spurted in
white sheets behind; the canoes bounded, length
on length, out of the water; and louder and faster
the guttural chant beat time. The Alaskans and
the Nooksacks were coming in together, carven
prow to carven prow, and the excitement was terrific.
Nearer and nearer, neither gaining, they
came. Then, suddenly, there burst a mad yell of
triumph, and the Alaskan boat arose from the
water and leaped almost its full length ahead of
the Nooksack’s; and amidst waving hats and
handkerchiefs, and almost frantic cheering—the
race was won.</p>

<p>“By the eternal!” said Diller, beginning to
breathe again and wiping the perspiration from
his brow. “If that isn’t worth crossing the plains
to see, I don’t know what is!” But his companion
did not hear. She was alternately waving
her kerchief to the victors and pounding her
small fists on the railing in an ecstasy of triumph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span></p>

<p>“Lavin-<i>ee</i>!”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“You come right down hyeer an’ help me
em’ty this renchin’-water. I’d like to know
what’s got into you! A-stayin’ upstairs half your
time, an’ just a-mopin’ around when you are
down. You ain’t b’en worth your salt lately!”</p>

<p>The girl came into the kitchen slowly. “What
you jawin’ about now, maw?” she said, smiling.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you what I’m a-jawin’ about, as
you call it. Take holt o’ this tub an’ help me
em’ty this renchin’-water.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t holler so; Mr. Diller’ll hear
you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care ’f he <i>does</i> hear me. I can give
him his come-up’ans if he goes to foolin’ around,
listenin’. I don’t care ’f he does write for a
paper in New York! You’ve got to take holt o’
the work more’n you’ve b’en lately. A-traipsin’
around all over the country with him, a-showin’
him things to write about an’ make fun of! I
sh’u’d think Bart Winn had just about got
enough of it.”</p>

<p>“I wish you’d keep still about Bart Winn,”
said Lavinia, impatiently.</p>

<p>“Well, I ain’t a-goin’ to keep still about him.”
Mrs. Vaiden poured the dish-water into the sink
and passed the dish-cloth round and round the
pan, inside and outside with mechanical care, before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
she opened the back door and hung it out on
the side of the house. “I guess I don’t haf to
ask <i>you</i> when I want to talk. There you was—gone
all day yeste’day a-huntin’ star-fish, an’ that
renchin’-water a-settin’ there a-ruinin’ that tub
because I couldn’t em’ty it all myself. Just as
if he never saw star-fish where he come from.
An’ then to-day—b’en gone all the mornin’
a-ketchin’ crabs! How many crabs ’d you ketch,
I’d like to know!”</p>

<p>“We didn’t ketch many,” said Lavinia, with
a soft, aggravating laugh. “The water wa’n’t
clear enough to see ’em.”</p>

<p>“No, I guess the water <i>wa’n’t</i> clear enough to
see ’em!” The rinsing-water had been emptied,
and Mrs. Vaiden was industriously wiping the
tub. “I’ve got all the star-fishin’ an’ the crab-ketchin’
I want, an’ I’m a-goin’ to tell that young
man that he can go some’ers else for his board.
He’s b’en here a month, an’ he’s just about made
a fool o’ you. Pret’ soon you’ll be a-thinkin’
you’re too good for Bart Winn.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Bart Winn’s honest voice in
the doorway; “I guess Laviny won’t never be
a-thinkin’ that.”</p>

<p>“Mercy!” cried Mrs. Vaiden, starting and
coloring guiltily. “That you? How you scairt
me! I’m all of a-trimble.”</p>

<p>Bart advanced to Lavinia and kissed her with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
much tenderness; but instead of blushing, she
paled.</p>

<p>“When ’d you come?” she asked, briefly,
drawing away, while her mother, muttering something
about the sour cream and the spring-house,
went out discreetly.</p>

<p>“This mornin’,” said Bart. “I’m a-goin’ to
stay home now.”</p>

<p>The girl sat down, taking a pan of potatoes on
her lap. “I wonder where the case-knife is,”
she said, helplessly.</p>

<p>“I’ll get it,” said Bart, running into the pantry
and returning with the knife. “I love to
wait on you, Laviny,” he added, with shining
eyes. “I guess I’ll get to wait on you a sight,
now. I see your paw ’s I come up an’ he said
as how I could board hyeer. I’ll do the shores
for you—an’ glad to. An’, oh, Laviny! I
’most forgot. I spoke for a buggy ’s I come up,
so’s I can take you a-ridin’ to-night.”</p>

<p>“I guess I can’t go,” said Lavinia, holding
her head down and paring potatoes as if her life
depended upon getting the skins off.</p>

<p>“You can’t? Why can’t you?”</p>

<p>“I—why, I’m goin’ a salmon-spearin’ up at
Squalicum Creek, I guess. Salmon’s a-runnin’
like everything now. ’Most half the town goes
there soon ’s it gets dark.”</p>

<p>“That a fact?” said Bart, shifting from one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
foot to the other and looking interested. “I
want to know! Well”—his face brightened—“I’ll
go down an’ tell ’em I’ll take the rig to-morro’
night, an’ I’ll go a-spearin’ with you.
Right down in front o’ Eldridge’s?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” A pulse began thumping violently in
the girl’s throat. Her eyelids got so heavy she
could not lift them. “I guess—that is, I—why,
you see, Bart, I got comp’ny.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess the girls won’t object to my
goin’ along o’ you.”</p>

<p>“It ain’t girls,” said Lavinia, desperately.
“It’s—a—it’s Mr. Diller; the gentleman that
boards here.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Bart, slowly. Then there was a
most trying silence, during which the ticking of
the clock and the beating of her own heart were
the only sounds Lavinia heard. At last she said,
feebly: “You see he writes for a New York
newspaper—one o’ the big ones. He’s a-writin’
up the whole Puget Sound country. An’ he
don’t know just what he’d ort to see, nor just
how to see it, unless somebody shows him about—an’
I’ve b’en a-showin’ him.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Bart again, but quite in another
tone, quite cheerfully. “That’s it, is ’t, Laviny?
Well, that’s all right. But I’ll be hanged if you
didn’t take my breath away for a minute. I
thought you meant—Laviny!”—a sudden seriousness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
came into his tone and look—“I guess
you don’t know how much I think o’ you. My
heart’s just <i>set</i> on you, my girl—my whole life’s
wrapped up in you.” He paused, but Lavinia
did not speak or look at him, and he added, very
slowly and thoughtfully—“I reckon it ’u’d just
about kill me, ’f anything happened to you.”</p>

<p>“I guess nothin’ ’s a-goin’ to happen.” She
dropped one potato into a pan of cold water and
took up another.</p>

<p>“No, I guess not.” He took on a lighter tone.
“But I’ll tell you what, Laviny! If that’s all,
he ain’t comp’ny at all; so you can just tell him
I’m a-goin’, too.” He came closer and laid a large
but very gentle hand on her shoulder. “You
might even tell him I’ve got a right to go, Laviny.”</p>

<p>The girl shrank, and glanced nervously at the
door.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t like to do that, Bart. After his
arrangin’ to go, an’ a-hirin’ the skiff hisself. <i>I</i>
don’t know but what he’s got somebody else to go
along of us.”</p>

<p>“Why, does he ever?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t recollect that he ever has; but
then he might of, this time, I say, for all I
know.”</p>

<p>There was another silence. Then the big hand
patted the girl’s shoulder affectionately and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
honest eyes bent on her the look of patient tenderness
that Diller had considered pathetic.</p>

<p>“All right, Laviny; you go along of him, just
by yourself, an’ I’ll stop home with your paw an’
your maw. I want you to know, my girl, that I
trust you, an’ believe every word you say to me.
I ain’t even thought o’ much else besides you
ever sence I saw you first time at the liberry sociable,
an’ I won’t ever think o’ much else, I
don’t care what happens. Bein’ afraid to trust a
body ’s a poor way to show how much you think
about ’em, is my religion; so you go an’ have a
good time, an’ don’t you worry about me.” He
tucked one of her runaway curls behind her ear
awkwardly. “I’ll slip down to the liv’ry stable
now, an’ tell ’em about the rig.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Lavinia.</p>

<p>Her mother came in one door, after a precautionary
scraping of her feet and an alarming
paroxysm of coughing, and looked rather disappointed
to see Bart going out at the other, and to
realize that her modest warnings had been thrown
away. “Well, ’f I <i>ever</i>!” she exclaimed. “Laviny
Vaiden, whatever makes you <i>look</i> so? You
look just ’s if you’d seen a spook! You’re a
kind o’ yellow-gray—just like you had the
ja’ndice! What <i>ails</i> you?”</p>

<p>“I got a headache,” said the girl; and then,
somehow, the pan slid down off her lap, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
potatoes and the parings went rolling and sprawling
all over the floor; Lavinia’s head went down
suddenly on the table, and she was sobbing bitterly.</p>

<p>Her mother looked at her keenly, without speaking,
for a moment; then she said dryly, “Why,
I guess you must have an awful headache. Come
on kind o’ sudden like, didn’t it? I guess you’d
best go up and lay down, an’ I’ll bring a mustard
plaster up an’ put on your head. Ain’t nothin’
like a plaster for a headache—’specially that kind
of a headache.”</p>

<p>Bart Winn walked into the livery stable with an
air of indifference put on so stiffly that it deceived
no one. It was not that he did not feel perfectly
satisfied with Lavinia’s explanation, but he was
a trifle uneasy lest others should not see the thing
with his eyes.</p>

<p>“I guess I won’t want that rig to-night, Billy,”
he said, pulling a head of timothy out of a bale
of hay that stood near. “I’ll take it to-morro’
night.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said the young fellow, with a smile
that Bart did not like. “Girl sick, aigh?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Bart, softly stripping the fuzz off
the timothy.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I understan’,” said Billy, winking
one eye, cheerfully. “I’ve b’en there myself.
Girls is as much alike ’s peas—<i>sweet</i>-peas”—he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
interjected with a hearty laugh—“in a pod,
the world over. It ain’t never safe for a fellow to
come home, after bein’ away a good spell, an’ engage
a buggy before findin’ out if the girl ain’t
engaged to some other fello’—it ain’t noways <i>safe</i>.
I smiled in my sleeve when you walked in so big
an’ ordered your’n.”</p>

<p>Bart Winn was slow to anger, but now a dull
red came upon his face and neck, and settled there
as if burnt into the flesh. His eyes looked dangerous,
but he spoke quietly. “I guess you don’t
know what you’re talkin’ about, Billy. I guess
you hadn’t best go any furder.”</p>

<p>Billy came slowly toward him, nettled by his
tone—by its very calm, in fact. “D’ you mean
to say that Laviny Vaiden ain’t goin’ a-salmon-spearin’
to-night with that dandy from New
York?”</p>

<p>Bart swallowed once or twice.</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to say anything that’s none o’
your business,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well, she’s been a-spearin’ with him ev’ry
night sence the salmon’s b’en a-runnin’, anyway.”</p>

<p>The strong, powerful trembling of a man who
is trying to control himself now seized Bart
Winn.</p>

<p>“If you’re goin’ to put on airs with me,” continued
Billy, obtusely, “I’ll just tell you a few
<i>fax</i>! They don’t burn any torch in their boat, an’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
they don’t spear any salmon! That’s just a blind.
They go off by theirselves—clear away from the
spearers, an’ they don’t come back till they see
the torches a-goin’ out an’ know that we all’s
a-goin’ home. It’s the town talk. Not that they
say anything wrong, for we’ve all knowed Laviny
sence she was a baby; but it’s as plain as the nose
on a man’s face that you ain’t in it there since that
dood come.”</p>

<p>A panorama of colors flamed over Bart’s face;
his hands clenched till the nails cut into the flesh
and the blood spurted; who has seen the look in
the eyes of the lion that cowers and obeys under
the terrible lash of the trainer will know the look
that was in the man’s eyes while the lash of his
own will conquered him; his broad chest swelled
and sunk. At last he spoke, in a deep, shaking
voice. “Billy,” he said, “you’re a liar—a liar!
<i>Damn you!</i>” He struggled a moment longer
with himself, and then turned and hurried away
as if possessed of the devil.</p>

<p>But Billy followed him to the door and called
after him—“Oh, damn me, aigh? Now, I don’t
want I sh’u’d have a fight with you, Bart. I was
tryin’ to do you a favor. If you think I’m a
liar, it’s a mighty easy thing for you to go down
there to-night an’ see for yourself. That’s all <i>I</i>
ask.”</p>

<p>Bart went on in a passion of contending emotions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
“He’s a liar! He’s a liar!” he kept
saying, deep in his throat; but all the time he
had the odd feeling that somebody, or something,
was contradicting him. A warm wind had arisen,
and it beat against his temples so persistently
that they felt numb by the time he reached the
Vaiden’s. He cleaned his boots on the neat mat
of gunny-sacking laid at the door for that purpose,
and entered the kitchen. “Where’s Laviny?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“She’s upstairs with a headache,” replied
Mrs. Vaiden, promptly.</p>

<p>“It must ’a’ come on sudden.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess it must.” Mrs. Vaiden spoke
cautiously. She was sure there had been a quarrel,
and she was afraid her own remark, overheard
by Bart, had brought it on.</p>

<p>“Well, I want to see her.”</p>

<p>“Right away?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Bart, after a little hesitation,
“right away, I reckon.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Vaiden went upstairs, and returned presently,
followed by Lavinia. The girl looked pale;
a white kerchief bound about her brow increased
her pallor; her eyes were red. She sat down
weakly in a splint-bottom chair and crossed her
hands in her lap.</p>

<p>At sight of the girl’s suffering, Bart knew instantly
that he had been doubting her without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
realizing it, because his faith in her came back
with such a strong rush of tenderness.</p>

<p>“Sick, Laviny?” he asked, in a tone that was
a caress of itself—it was so very gentle a thing
to come from so powerful a man.</p>

<p>“I got a headache,” said Lavinia, looking at
the floor. “It came on right after you left. It
aches awful.”</p>

<p>Bart went to her and laid his hand on her
shoulder. It was a strong hand to be shaking
so.</p>

<p>“Laviny, I’m a brute to get you up out o’ bed;
but I’m more of a brute to ’a’ believed”—He
stopped, and she lifted her eyes, fearfully, to his
face. “I’ve been listenin’ to things about you.”</p>

<p>“What things?” She looked at the floor
again.</p>

<p>“Well, I ain’t goin’ to so much as ask you ’f
it’s so; but I’m goin’ to tell you how <i>mean</i> I’ve
b’en to listen to ’t an’ to keep a-wonderin’ if it
c’u’d be so,—an’ then see if you can forgive me.
I’ve b’en hearin’ that you don’t light no torch
nor ketch no salmon when you go a-spearin’, but
that you an’ him go off by yourselves an’ stay—an’
that he—he”—the words seemed to stick in
his throat—“he’s cut me out.”</p>

<p>After a little Lavinia said—“Is that all?”</p>

<p>“All! Yes. Ain’t that enough?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s enough—plenty for you to ’a’ believed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
about me. I wouldn’t ’a’ believed that
much about you.” The humor of this remark
seemed to appeal to her, for she smiled a little.
Then she got up. “But it’s all right, Bart. I
ain’t mad. If that’s all, I guess I’ll go back to
bed. You tell maw I couldn’t put them roastin’-ears
on—my head feels so.”</p>

<p>He caught her to his breast and kissed her
several times, with something like a prayer in his
eyes, and with a strong, but sternly controlled
passion that left him trembling and staggering
like a drunken man when she was gone.</p>

<p class="tb">After Lavinia and Diller were gone that night
Bart sat out on the kitchen steps, smoking his
pipe. He stooped forward, his elbows resting on
his knees. His right hand held the pipe, and the
left supported his right arm. His eyes looked
straight before him into the purple twilight. The
wind had gone down, but now and then a little
gust of perfume came around the corner from the
wild clover, still in delicate pink blossom on the
north side of the house. The stars came out, one
by one, in the deep blue spaces above, and shrill
mournful outcries came from winged things in the
green depths of the ferns. Already the torches
of the salmon-spearers were beginning to flare out
from the shadow of the cliffs across the bay. Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
Vaiden was not at home, but Mrs. Vaiden was
walking about heavily in the kitchen, finishing
the evening work.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vaiden was not quite easy in her mind. She
really liked Bart Winn, but, to be unnecessarily
and disagreeably truthful, she liked even better his
noble donation claim, which he was now selling
off in town lots. Time and time again during
the past month she had cautioned Lavinia to not
“go galivantin’ ’round with that Diller so much;”
and on numerous occasions she had affirmed that
“she’d <i>bet</i> Laviny would fool along till she let
Bart Winn slip through her fingers, after all.”
Still, it had been an unconfessed satisfaction to
her to observe Mr. Diller’s frank admiration for
her daughter—to feel that Lavinia could “have
her pick o’ the best any day.” She knew how
this rankled in some of the neighbors’ breasts.
She wished now that she had been more strict.
She said to herself, as she went out to the spring-house:
“I wish I’d ’a’ set my foot right down on
his goin’ a step with her. An’ there I started it
myself, a-sendin’ her off to that c’noe race with
him, just to tantalize Mis’ Bentley an’ her troop
o’ girls. But land knows I never dreamt o’ its
goin’ on this way. What’s a newspaper fello’
compared to a donation claim, <i>I’d</i> like to know?”</p>

<p>At nine o’clock she went to the door and said,
in that tone of conciliatory tenderness which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
comes from a remorseful conscience: “Well,
Bart, I guess I’ll go to bed. I’m tired. You
goin’ to set up for Laviny?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Bart; “good-night.”</p>

<p>“Well, good-night, Bart.” She stood holding
a lighted candle in one hand, protecting its flame
from the night air with the other. “I reckon
they’ll be home by ten.”</p>

<p>“I reckon so.”</p>

<p>At the top of the stairs Mrs. Vaiden remembered
that the parlor windows were open, and
she went back to close them. The wind was rising
again, and as she opened the parlor door it
puffed through the open windows and sent the
curtains streaming out into the room; then it
went whistling on through the house, banging
the doors.</p>

<p>After a while quiet came upon the house.
Bart sat smoking silently. The Vaidens lived on
a hill above the town, and usually he liked
to watch the chains of electric lights curving
around the bay; but to-night he watched the
torches only. Suddenly he flung his pipe down
with a passionate movement and stood up, reaching
inside the door for his hat. But he sat down
again as suddenly, shaking himself like a dog, as
if to fling off something that was upon him. “No;
I’m damned if I will!” he said in his throat.
“I <i>won’t</i> watch her! She said it wa’n’t so, an’ I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
believe her.” But he did not smoke again, and he
breathed more heavily as the moments ticked by
and she did not come. At half-past ten Mrs.
Vaiden came down in a calico wrapper and a
worsted shawl.</p>

<p>“Why, ain’t she come <i>yet</i>?” she asked, holding
the candle high and peering under it at the
back of the silent figure outside.</p>

<p>“No,” said Bart quietly; “she ain’t.”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s half-after ten! She never’s b’en
out this a-way before. D’you think anything
c’u’d ’a’ hapened?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Bart, slowly; “I guess they’ll be
along.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t want that she sh’u’d stay out
till this time o’ night with anybody but you.
She’s old enough to know better. It don’t look
well.”</p>

<p>“It looks all right, as fur as that goes,” said
Bart.</p>

<p>“Oh, if <i>you</i> think so.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Vaiden lowered the candle huffily.</p>

<p>Bart arose and came inside. He was pale but
he spoke calmly, and he looked her straight in the
eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s all right as fur as she goes; I’d trust her
anywheres. But how about him? What kind
of a man is he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” said Mrs. Vaiden, weakly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
“How d’ you expect me to know what kind of a
<i>man</i> he is? He’s a nice-appearin’, polite sort of a
fello’, an’ he writes for a newspaper ’n New York—one
o’ them big ones. But he don’t seem to
me to have much backbone or stand-upness about
him. I sh’u’d think he’s one o’ them that never
<i>intends</i> to do anything wrong, but does it just because
it’s pleasant for the time bein’, and then
feels sorry for ’t afte’ards.”</p>

<p>Bart’s brows bent together blackly.</p>

<p>“But I must say”—Mrs. Vaiden’s tone gathered
firmness—“you might pattern after him a
little in politeness, Bart. I think Laviny likes it.
He’s alwus openin’ gates for her, an’ runnin’ to
set chairs for her when she comes into a room,
an’ takin’ off his hat to her, an’ carryin’ her umberella,
an’ fetchin’ her flow’rs; an’ I b’lieve he’d
most die before he’d walk on the inside o’ the
sidewalk or go over a crossin’ ahead o’ her. An’
I can see Laviny likes them things.”</p>

<p>She put the candle on the table and huddled
down into a chair.</p>

<p>The look of anger on the man’s face gave
place to one of keen dismay.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know she liked such things. I never
thought about ’em. I wa’n’t brought up to such
foolishness.”</p>

<p>“Well, she likes ’em, anyhow. I guess most
women do.” Mrs. Vaiden sighed unconsciously.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
“Why, Bart, it’s a quarter of, an’ she ain’t here
yet. D’ you want I sh’u’d go after her?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want you sh’u’d go after her. I
want you sh’u’d let her alone, an’ show her we
got confidence in her. She’s just the same as my
wife, an’ I don’t want her own mother sh’u’d
think she’d do anything she hadn’t ort to.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Vaiden’s feelings were sensitive and easily
hurt; and she sat now in icy silence, looking at
the clock. But when it struck eleven she thawed,
being now thoroughly frightened.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bart, I do think we’d best look in her
room. She might ’a’ got in someway without
our hearin’ her—an’ us settin’ hyeer like a
couple o’ bumps on a lawg.”</p>

<p>“She might ’a’,” said Bart, as if struck by the
suggestion. “You get me a candle an’ I’ll go
up and see. You stay here,” he added, over his
shoulder, as he took the candle and started.</p>

<p>“Look out!” she cried, sharply, as the blue
flame plowed a gutter down one side of the candle.
“Don’t hold it so crooked! You’ll spill the
sperm onto the stair-carpet!”</p>

<p>It was with a feeling of awe that Bart went
into the dainty little room. There were rosebuds
on the creamy wall-paper, and the ceiling, slanting
down on one side, was pale, pale blue,
spangled with silver stars; the windows were
closed, and thin, soft curtains fell in straight folds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
over them; the rag carpet was woven in pink-and-cream
stripes; there was a dressing-table
prettily draped in pink. For a moment the man’s
love was stronger than his anxiety; the prayer
came back to his eyes as he looked at the narrow,
snowy bed.</p>

<p>Then he went to the dressing-table and saw a
folded slip of paper with his name upon it.</p>

<p class="tb">After a while he became conscious that he had
read the letter a dozen times, and still had not
grasped its meaning. He stooped closer to the
candle and read it again, his lips moving mechanically:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Bart</span>:—I’m goin’ away. I’m goin’ with
him. I told you what wa’n’t so this mornin’. I do like
him the best. I couldn’t have you after knowin’ him.
I feel awful bad to treat you this a-way, but I haf to.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Laviny.</span>”</p>

<p>“P. S.—I want that you sh’u’d marry somebody else
as soon as you can, an’ be happy.”</p>

</div>

<p>A querulous call came from the hall below.
He took the candle in one hand and the letter in
the other and went down, stumbling clumsily on
the stairs. A great many noises seemed to be
ringing in his head, and the sober paper with
which the walls of the hall were covered to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
suddenly taken on great scarlet spots. He felt
helpless and uncertain in his movements, as if he
had no will to guide him. He must have carried
the candle very crookedly, for Mrs. Vaiden, who
was watching him from below, cried out, petulantly:
“There, you <i>are</i> spillin’ the sperm!
Just look at you!” But she stopped abruptly
when she saw his face.</p>

<p>“Why, whatever on this earth!” she exclaimed,
solemnly. “What you got there? A letter?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” He set the candle on the table and
held the letter toward her. “It’s from Laviny.”</p>

<p>“From Laviny! Why, what on earth did she
write to you about?”</p>

<p>He burst into wild, terrible laughter. “She
wants I sh’u’d marry somebody else as soon as I
can, an’ be happy.” These words, at least,
seemed to have written themselves on his brain.
He groped about blindly for his hat, and went
out into the shrill, whistling night. The last
torch had burnt itself out, and everything was
black save the electric lights, winking in the
wind, and one strip of whitening sky above Mount
Baker, where presently the moon would rise, silver
and cool.</p>

<p class="tb">It was seven o’clock in the morning when he
came back. He washed his hands and face at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
sink on the porch, and combed his hair before a
tiny mirror, in which a dozen reflections of himself
danced. Mrs. Vaiden was frying ham. At
sight of him she began to cry, weakly and noiselessly.
“Where you been?” she sniffled. “You
look forty year old. I set up till one o’clock,
a-waitin’ for you.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Vaiden,” said Bart, quietly, “I’m in
great trouble. I’ve walked all night, tryin’ to
make up my mind to ’t. I’ve done it at last;
but I cu’dn’t ’a’ come back tell I did. I’m sorry
you waited up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mind that as long as you’re gettin’
reconciled to ’t, Bart.” Mrs. Vaiden spoke
more hopefully. “You set right down an’ have
a bite to eat.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want anything,” he replied; but he
sat down and took a cup of coffee. It must have
been very hot, for suddenly great tears came into
his eyes and stood there. Mrs. Vaiden sat down
opposite to him and leaned her elbow on the table
and her head on her hand. “Bart,” she said,
solemnly, “I don’t want you sh’u’d think I ever
winked at this. It never entered my head. My
heart’s just broke. To see a likely girl, that c’u’d
’a’ had her pick anywheres, up an’ run away with
a no-account newspaper fello’—when she c’u’d
’a’ had you!” The man’s face contracted.
“Whatever on earth the neighbors’ll say I don’t
know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span></p>

<p>“Who cares what neighbors say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all very well for you to say; you
ain’t her mother.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Bart, with a look that made her
quail; “I ain’t. I wish to God I was! Mebbe
’twouldn’t <i>hurt</i> so!”</p>

<p>“Well, it ’ad ort to hurt more!” retorted the
lady, with spirit. “Just ’s if you felt any worse
’n I do!” He laid his head on his hand and
groaned. “Oh, I know it’s gone deep, Bart”—her
tone softened—“but ’s I say, you ain’t her
mother. You’ll get over it an’ marry again—like
Laviny wanted that you sh’u’d. It was good
o’ her to think o’ that. I will say that much for
her.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Bart; “it was good of her.”
Then there came a little silence, broken finally
by Mrs. Vaiden. Her voice held a note of peevish
regret. “There’s that fine house o’ your’n
’most finished—two story an’ a ell! An’ that
liberry across the front hall from the parlor!
When I think how vain Laviny was o’ that liberry!
What’ll you do with the house, now,
Bart?”</p>

<p>“Sell it!” he answered, between his teeth.</p>

<p>“An’ there’s all that fine furnitur’ that Laviny
an’ you picked out. She fairly danced when she
told me about it. All covered with satin—robin-egg
green, wa’n’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span></p>

<p>“Blue.” The word dropped mechanically from
his white lips.</p>

<p>“Well, blue, then. What’ll you do with it?”</p>

<p>“I guess they’ll take it back by my losin’ my
first payment,” he answered, with a kind of
ghastly humor.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s your new buggy—all paid for.
They won’t take that back.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give that to you,” he said, with a bitter
smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, you!” exclaimed Mrs. Vaiden, throwing
out her large hand at him in a gesture of mingled
embarrassment and delight. “As if I’d take it,
after Laviny’s actin’ up this a-way!”</p>

<p>He did not reply, and presently she broke out,
angrily, with:</p>

<p>“The huzzy! The ungrateful, deceitful jade!
To treat a body so. How do we know whether
he’s got anything to keep a wife on? I’ll admit,
though, he was alwus genteel-dressed. I do
think, Bart, you might ’a’ took pattern ’n that.
’Twa’n’t like as if you wa’n’t able to wear good
clo’es—an’ Laviny liked such things.”</p>

<p>“I wish you’d ’a’ told me a good spell ago
what she liked, Mrs. Vaiden.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s so. There ain’t much use ’n
lockin’ the stable door after the horse ’s gone.
Oh, that makes me think about your offerin’ me
that buggy—’s if I w’u’d!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span></p>

<p>“I guess you’ll have to. I’m goin’ to leave on
the train, an’ I’ll order it sent to you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you! Why, where you goin’, Bart?”</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to follow <i>him</i>!” he thundered,
bringing his fist down on the table in a way that
made every dish leap out of its place. “I ain’t
goin’ to hurt him—unless talk hurts—but I’m
goin’ to say some <i>things</i> to him. I ain’t had a
thought for three year that that girl ain’t b’en in!
I ain’t made a plan that she ain’t b’en in. I’ve
laid awake night after night just too happy to
sleep. An’ now to have a—a <i>thing</i> like him take
her from me in one month. But that ain’t the
worst!” he burst out, passionately. “We don’t
know how he’ll treat her, an’ she’ll be too proud
to complain—”</p>

<p>“I can’t see why you care how he treats her,”
said Mrs. Vaiden, “after the way she’s treated
you.”</p>

<p>“No,” he answered, with a look that ought to
have crushed her, “I didn’t s’pose you c’u’d see.
I didn’t expect you to see that, or anything else
but your own feelin’s—the way the thing affex
you. But that’s what I’m goin’ to follow him
for, Mrs. Vaiden. An’ when I find him—I’m
goin’ to tell him”—there was an awful calm in
his tone now—“that if he ever misuses her, now
that he’s married her, I’ll kill him. I’ll shoot
him down like a dawg!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span></p>

<p>“My Lord!” broke in Mrs. Vaiden, with a
new thought. “What if he ain’t married her!
She never said so ’n her letter. Oh, Bart!” beginning
to weep hysterically. “Mebbe you c’u’d
get her back.”</p>

<p>He leaped to his feet panting like an animal;
his great breast swelled in and out swiftly, his
hands clenched, his eyes burned at her.</p>

<p>“What!” he said. “Do you <i>dare</i>? <i>Her
mother!</i> Oh, you—you—God! but I wish you
was a man!”</p>

<p>The whistle of a coming train broke across the
morning stillness. He turned, seized his hat and
crushed it on his head. Then he came back and
took up the chair in which he had been sitting.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Vaiden,” he said, quietly, “d’ you see
this chair? Well, if he ain’t married her—”</p>

<p>With two or three movements of his powerful
wrists he wrenched the chair into as many pieces
and dropped them on the floor.</p>

<p class="tb">After a while Mrs. Vaiden emerged from the
stupefaction into which his last words had thrown
her, and resumed her breakfast.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, stirring her coffee until it
swam round and round in a smooth eddy in the cup,
“if I ever see his beat! Whoever’d ’a’ thought
he’d take his cuttin’-out that a-way? I never ’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
’a’ thought it. Worryin’ about her, after the way
she’s up and used him! A body ’d think he’d
be glad if she was treated shameful, and hatto
lead a mis’rable life a-realizin’ what she’d threw
away. But not him. Well, they say still water
runs deep. Mebbe it’s ungrateful to think it after
his givin’ me that fine buggy—(How Mis’ Bentley
will stare when I drive roun’ to see her!” she
interjected with a smile of anticipation.) “But
after seein’ how he showed up his temper just
now I ain’t sure but Laviny’s head was level
when she took the other ’n. ’F <i>only</i> he had a
donation claim!”</p>

<h3>ZARELDA</h3>

<p>“’Reldy! Say, ’Reldy Za-<i>rel</i>-dy!”</p>

<p>The girl was walking rapidly, but she stopped
at once and turned. She wore a cheap woolen
dress of a dingy brown color. The sleeves were
soiled at the wrists, but the narrow, inexpensive
ruffle at the neck was white and fresh. Her thick
brown hair was well brushed and clean. It was
woven into a heavy, glistening braid which was
looped up and tied with a rose-colored ribbon.
Her shoes were worn out of shape and “run
down” at the heels, and there were no gloves on
the roughened hands clasped over the handle of
her dinner-bucket.</p>

<p>“Oh, you?” she said, smiling.</p>

<p>“Yes, me,” said the other girl, with a high
color, as she joined Zarelda. They walked along
briskly together. “I’ve been tryin’ to ketch up
with you for three blocks. Ain’t you early?”</p>

<p>“No; late. Heard the whistle blow ’fore I
left home. Didn’t you hear it? Now own up,
Em Brackett.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t—honest,” said the other girl,
laughing. “I set the clock back las’ night an’
forgot to turn it ahead ag’in this mornin’.”</p>

<p>This young woman’s dress and manner differed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
from her companion’s. Her dress was cheap, but
of flimsy, figured goods that under close inspection
revealed many and large grease spots; the
sleeves were fashionably puffed; and there were
ruffles and frills and plaitings all over it. At
the throat was a bit of satin ruffling that had
once been pale blue. Half her hair had been cut
off, making what she called her “bangs,” and
this was tightly frizzed over her head as far back
as her ears. Her back hair—coarse and broken
from many crimpings—was braided and looped
up like Zarelda’s, and tied with a soiled blue ribbon.
She wore much cheap jewelry, especially
amethysts in gaudy settings. She carried herself
with an air and was popularly supposed by the
young people of factory society to be very much
of a belle and a coquette.</p>

<p>Zarelda turned and looked at her with sudden
interest.</p>

<p>“What in the name o’ mercy did you turn the
clock back for?”</p>

<p>Em tossed her head, laughing and blushing.</p>

<p>“Never you mind what for, ’Reldy Winser.
It ain’t any o’ your funeral, I guess, if I did turn
it back. I had occasion to—that’s all. You
wasn’t at the dance up at Canemah las’ night,
was you?” she added suddenly.</p>

<p>“No, I wasn’t. I didn’t have anybody to go
with. You didn’t go, either, did you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span></p>

<p>“Unh-hunh; I did.”</p>

<p>Em nodded her head, looking up the river to
the great Falls, with dreamy, remembering eyes.
“We had a splendid time, an’ the walk home
along the river was just fine.”</p>

<p>“Well, I could of gone with you if I’d of knew
you was goin’. Couldn’t I? Maw was reel well
las’ night, too.”</p>

<p>She waited for a reply, but receiving none, repeated
rather wistfully—“Couldn’t I?”</p>

<p>Em took her eyes with some reluctance away
from the river and looked straight before her.</p>

<p>“Why, I guess,” she said, slowly and with
slight condescension. “At least, I wouldn’t of
cared if my comp’ny wouldn’t; an’ I guess”—with
a beautiful burst of generosity—“he wouldn’t
of minded much.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Zarelda, “you had comp’ny, did
you?”</p>

<p>“W’y, of course. You didn’t s’pose I went up
there all alone of myself, did you?”</p>

<p>“You an’ me ust to go alone places, without
any fellow, I mean,” said Zarelda. A little color
came slowly into her face. She felt vaguely hurt
by the other’s tone. “I thought mebbe you went
with some o’ the other girls.”</p>

<p>“I don’t go around that way any more.” Em
lifted her chin an inch higher. “When I can’t
have an—escort”—she uttered the word with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
some hesitation, fearing Zarelda might laugh at
it—“I’ll stay home.”</p>

<p>Then she added abruptly in a reminiscent
tone—“Maw acted up awful over my goin’ with
him. Thought for a spell I wouldn’t get to go.
But at last I flared all up an’ told her if I couldn’t
go I’d just up an’ leave for good. That brought
her around to the whipple-trees double quick, I
can tell you. I guess she won’t say much agen
my goin’ with him another time.”</p>

<p>“Goin’ with who?” said Zarelda. Em looked
at her, smiling.</p>

<p>“For the land o’ love! D’ you mean to say
you don’t know? I thought you’d of guessed.
W’y, that’s what made maw so mad—she was
just hoppin’, I tell you. That’s what made her
act up so. Said all the neighbors ’u’d say I was
tryin’ to get him away from you.”</p>

<p>In an instant the blood had flamed all over Zarelda’s
face and neck.</p>

<p>“Get who away from me, Em Brackett?”</p>

<p>“As if there was so many to get!” said Em,
laughing.</p>

<p>“Who are you a-talkin’ about?” said Zarelda,
sternly. Her face was paling now. “What of I
got to do with you an’ your comp’ny an’ your
maw’s actin’-ups, I’d like to know. Who <i>was</i>
your comp’ny?”</p>

<p>“Jim Sheppard; he”—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span></p>

<p>“Jim Sheppard!” cried Zarelda, furiously. She
turned a white face to her companion, but her
eyes were blazing. “What do I care for Jim
Sheppard? Aigh? What do I care who he takes
to dances up at Canemah? Aigh? You tell your
maw, Em Brackett, that she needn’t to trouble to
act up on my account. She can save her actin’-ups
for somebody that needs ’em! You tell her
that, will you?”</p>

<p>“Well, I will,” said Em, unmoved. “I’m
glad you don’t mind, ’Reldy. I felt some uneasy
myself, seein’ ’s how stiddy he’d been goin’ with
you.”</p>

<p>“Well, that don’t hender his goin’ with somebody
else, does it? I ain’t very likely to keep
him from pleasin’ hisself, am I?”</p>

<p>“Don’t go to workin’ yourself up so, ’Reldy.
If you don’t care, there’s no use in flarin’ up so.
My! Just look at this em’rald ring in at Shindy’s.
Ain’t that a beaut’?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t got time.” Zarelda walked on with
her head up. “Don’t you see we’re late a’ready?
The machin’ry’s all a-goin’, long ago.”</p>

<p>The two girls pushed through the swinging gate
and ran up the half-dozen steps to the entrance
of the big, brick woolen mills. A young man in
a flannel shirt and brown overalls was passing
through the outer hall. He was twirling a full,
crimson rose in his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span></p>

<p>As the girls hurried in, he paused and stood
awkwardly waiting for them, with a red face.</p>

<p>“Good mornin’,” he said, looking first at Em
and then, somewhat shamefacedly, at Zarelda.</p>

<p>“Good mornin’, Jim,” said Zarelda, coolly.
She was still pale, but she smiled as she pressed
on into the weaving-room. The many-tongued
roar of the machinery burst through the open
door to greet her. Em lingered behind a moment;
and when she passed Zarelda’s loom there was a
crimson rose in her girdle and two more in her
cheeks.</p>

<p>Five hours of monotonous work followed. Zarelda
stood patiently by her loom, unmindful of
the toilers around her and the deafening noise;
she did not lift her eyes from her work. She was
the youngest weaver in the factory and one of the
most careful and conscientious.</p>

<p>The marking-room was in the basement, and in
its quietest corner was a large stove whereon the
factory-girls were permitted to warm their lunches.
When the whistle sounded at noon they ceased
work instantly, seized their lunch baskets, and
sped—pushing, laughing, jostling—down the
stairs to the basement. There was a small, rickety
elevator at the rear of the factory, and some
of the more reckless ones leaped upon it and let
themselves down with the rope.</p>

<p>Zarelda was timid about the elevator; but that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
noon she sprang upon it and giving the rope a
jerk went spinning down to the ground. As she
entered the marking-room one of the overseers
saw her. “What!” he exclaimed, “Did you
come down that elevator, ’Reldy? I thought you
had more sense ’n some o’ the other girls. Why, it
ain’t safe! You’re liable to get killed on it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” said Zarelda, with a short, contemptuous
laugh. “I’d just as soon go over the
falls in an Indian dug-out.”</p>

<p>“You must want to shuffle off mighty bad,”
said the overseer. Then he added kindly, for he
and all the other overseers liked her—“What’s
got into you, ’Reldy? Anything ail you?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the girl; “nothin’ ails me.” But
his kind tone had brought sudden, stinging tears
to her eyes.</p>

<p>She went on silently to the stove and set her
bucket upon it. It contained thick vegetable
soup, which, with soda crackers, constituted her
dinner. She sat down to watch it, stirring it occasionally
with a tin spoon. Twenty other girls
were crowding around the stove. Em was among
them. Zarelda saw the big red rose lolling in
her girdle. She turned her eyes resolutely away
from it, only to find them going back again and
again.</p>

<p>“Hey! Where ’d you get your rose at, Em
Brackett?” cried one of the girls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span></p>

<p>“Jim Sheppard gave it to her,” trebled another,
before Em could reply. “I see him have it pinned
onto his flannel shirt before the whistle blew.”</p>

<p>“<i>Jim Sheppard!</i> Oh, my!”</p>

<p>There was a subdued titter behind Zarelda’s
back. She stirred the soup without lifting her
eyes. “She went livid, though, an’ then she
went white!” one of the girls who read yellow
novels declared afterward, tragically.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Matt Wilson, sitting down on a
bench and commencing to eat a great slice of
bread thinly covered with butter, “who went to
the dance up at Stringtown las’ night?”</p>

<p>All the girls but two flung unclean hands above
their heads. There was a merry outcry of “I
did! I did!”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t,” said Matt. “My little lame
sister coaxed me to wheel her down town, an’
then it was too late.”</p>

<p>“Why wasn’t you there, Zarelda Winser?”
cried Belle Church, opening her dinner-bucket
and examining the contents with the air of an epicurean.</p>

<p>For a second or two Zarelda wished honestly
that she had a lame sister or an invalid mother.
Then she said, quite calmly—“I didn’t have any
body to go with. That’s why.” She turned and
faced them all as she spoke.</p>

<p>With a fine delicacy which was certainly not acquired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
by education, every girl except Matt looked
away from Zarelda’s face. Matt, not having been
to the dance, was not in the secret.</p>

<p>But Zarelda did not change countenance. She
sat calmly eating her soup from the bucket with
the tin spoon. She took it noisily from the point
of the spoon; it was so thick that it was like eating
a vegetable dinner.</p>

<p>“Didn’t have anybody to go with?” repeated
Matt, laughing loudly. “I call that good. A
girl that’s had steady comp’ny for a year! Comp’ny
that’s tagged her closer ’n her shadder! An’
I did hear”—she shattered the shell of a hard-boiled
egg by hammering it on the bench, and began
picking off the pieces—“that your maw was
makin’ you up a whole trunkful o’ new underclo’s—all
trimmed up with tattin’ an’ crochet an’
serpentine braid—with insertin’ two inches wide
on ’em, too. You didn’t have anybody to go
with, aigh? What’s the matter with Jim Sheppard?”</p>

<p>Zarelda set her eyes on the red rose, as if that
gave her courage.</p>

<p>“He took Em Brackett.”</p>

<p>“Not much!” said Matt, turning sharply.
“Honest? Well, then, he only took her because
you couldn’t go an’ ast him to take her instid.”</p>

<p>“Why, the idee!” exclaimed Em, coloring
angrily and fluttering until the rose almost fell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
out of her girdle. “Zarelda Winser, you tell her
that ain’t so!”</p>

<p>“No, it ain’t so,” said Zarelda, composedly,
finishing her soup and beginning on a soda
cracker. “He didn’t ask me at all. He asked
Em hisself.”</p>

<p>“My!” said Net Carter, who had not been giving
attention to the conversation. “What larrapin’
good lunches you do have, Em Brackett.
Chicken sandwich, an’ spiced cur’nts, an’ cake!
My!”</p>

<p>Em Brackett looked out of the cobwebbed window
at a small dwelling between the factory and
the river. “I wonder why Mis’ Allen don’t hide
up that ugly porch o’ her’n with vines,” she said,
frostily. In factory society “larrapin” was not
considered a polite word and a snub invariably
awaited the unfortunate young woman who used
it. The line must be drawn.</p>

<p>When the whistle blew the girls started leisurely
for the stairs. There would be fifteen minutes
during which they might stand around the halls
and talk to the young men. Zarelda fell back,
permitting all to precede her. Em looked back
once or twice to see where she was.</p>

<p>“Well, if that ’Reldy Winser ain’t grit!” whispered
Nell Curry to Min Aster. “Just as good
as acknowledgin’ he’s threw off on her, an’ her
a-holdin’ up her head that way. There ain’t another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
girl in the factory c’u’d do that—without
flinchin’, too.”</p>

<p>When Zarelda reached the first hall she looked
about her deliberately for Jim Sheppard. It had
been his custom to meet her at the head of the stairs
and going with her to one of the windows overlooking
the Falls, to talk until the second whistle
sent them to their looms. With a resolute air she
joined Em Brackett, who was looking unusually
pretty with a flush of excitement on her face and
a defiant sparkle in her eyes.</p>

<p>In a moment Jim Sheppard came in. He hesitated
when he saw the two girls together. A dull
red went over his face. Then he crossed the hall
and deliberately ignoring Zarelda, smiled into
Em’s boldly inviting eyes and said, distinctly—“Em,
don’t you want to take a little walk?
There’s just time.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” said Em, with a flash of poorly
concealed triumph. “’Reldy, if you’re a-goin’
on upstairs, would you just as lieve pack my
bucket up?”</p>

<p>“I’d just as lieve.” Zarelda took the bucket,
and the young couple walked away airily.</p>

<p>This was the way the factory young men had
of disclosing their preferences. It was considered
quite proper for a young man and a young woman
to “go together” for months, or even years, and
for one to “throw off” on the other, when attracted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
by a fresher face, with no explanation or
apology.</p>

<p>“Well,” whispered Belle Church, “I guess
there ain’t one of us but’s been threw off on some
time or other, so we know how it feels. But this
is worse. He’s been goin’ with her more’n a year—an
then to stop off so sudden!”</p>

<p>“It’s better to stop off sudden than slow,” said
Matt Wilson, with an air of grim wisdom. “It
hurts worse, but it don’t hurt so long. Well, if
I ever! Just look at that!”</p>

<p>Out of sheer pity Frank Haddon had sidled out
of a group of young men and made his way hesitatingly
to Zarelda. “’Reldy,” he said, “don’t
you want to—want to—take a walk, too?”</p>

<p>The girl’s eyes flamed at him. She knew that
he was pitying her, and she was not of a nature
to accept pity meekly. “No!” she flashed out,
with scorn. “I don’t want to—want to”—mimicking
his tone—“take a walk, too. If I did, I
guess I know the road.”</p>

<p>She went upstairs, holding her head high.</p>

<p>When Zarelda went home that evening she
found the family already at the supper table. The
Winsers were not very particular about their home
manners.</p>

<p>“We don’t wait on each other here,” Mrs. Winser
explained, frequently, with pride, to her neighbors.
“When a meal’s done, on the table it goes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
in a jiffy, an’ such of us as is here, eat. I just
put the things back in the oven an’ keep ’em hot
for them that ain’t on hand.”</p>

<p>Zarelda was compelled to pass through the
kitchen to reach the stairs.</p>

<p>“Well, ’Reldy,” said her mother, “you’re
here at last, be you? Hurry up an’ wash yourself.
Your supper’s in the oven, but I guess
the fire’s about out. It does beat all how quick
it goes out. Paw, I do wish you’d hump yourself
an’ git some dry wood. It ’u’d try the soul of a
saint to cook with that green stuff. Sap fairly
<i>oozes</i> out of it!”</p>

<p>“I don’t want any supper, maw,” said Zarelda.</p>

<p>“You don’t want any supper! What ails you?
Aigh?”</p>

<p>“I don’t feel hungry. I got a headache.”</p>

<p>She passed the table without a glance and went
upstairs. Her mother arose, pushing back her
chair with decision and followed her. When she
reached Zarelda’s room, the girl was on her knees
before her trunk. She had taken out a small
writing-desk and was fitting a tiny key in the
lock. Her hat was still on her head, but pushed
back.</p>

<p>She started when the door opened, and looked
over her shoulder, flushing with embarrassment
and annoyance. Then, without haste or nervousness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
she replaced the desk and closing the trunk,
stood up calmly and faced her mother.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you want any supper?” Mrs.
Winser took in the trunk, the desk, and the blush
at one glance. “Be you sick?”</p>

<p>“I got a headache.” Zarelda took off her hat
and commenced drawing the pins out of her hair.
She untied the red ribbon and rolled it tightly
around three fingers to smooth out the creases.</p>

<p>“Well, you wasn’t puttin’ your headache ’n
your writin’-desk, was you?”</p>

<p>“No, I wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“Now, see here, ’Reldy,” said Mrs. Winser,
very kindly, coming closer and resting one large
hand on the bureau; “there’s somethin’ ails you
besides a headache, an’ you ain’t a-goin’ to pull
any wool over my eyes. You’ve hed lots an’ lots
o’ headaches an’ et your supper just the same.
What ails you?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ ails me, maw.”</p>

<p>“There does, too, somethin’ ail you. I guess
I know. Now, what is it? You might just as
well spit it right out an’ be done with it.”</p>

<p>Zarelda was silent. She began brushing her
hair with a dingy brush from which tufts of
bristles had been worn in several places. Her
mother watched her patiently for a few moments,
then she said—“Well, ’Reldy, be you goin’ to
tell me what ails you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span></p>

<p>Still there was no reply.</p>

<p>“You ain’t turned off in the fact’ry, be you?”</p>

<p>Zarelda shook her head.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said Mrs. Winser slowly, as if
reluctantly admitting a thought that she had
been repelling, “it’s somethin’ about Jim Sheppard.”</p>

<p>The girl paled and brushed her hair over her
face to screen it from her mother’s searching gaze.</p>

<p>“Have you fell out with him?”</p>

<p>“No, I ain’t fell out with him. Hadn’t you
best eat your supper before it gets cold, maw?”</p>

<p>“No, I hadn’t best. I ain’t a-goin’ to budge a
blessed step out o’ this here room tell I know what
ails you. Not if I have to stay here tell daylight.”
After a brief reflection she added—“Now, don’t
you tell me he’s been cuttin’ up any! I always
said he was a fine young man, an’ I say so still.”</p>

<p>“He ain’t been cuttin’ up any,” said Zarelda.
“At least, not as I know of.”</p>

<p>She laid down the brush and pushing her hair
all back with both hands, fronted her mother suddenly,
pale but resolute.</p>

<p>“If you want to know so bad,” she said, “I’ll
tell you. He’s threw off on me.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Winser sunk helplessly into a chair.
“Threw off on you!” she gasped.</p>

<p>“Yes, threw off on me.” Zarelda kept her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
dry, burning eyes on her mother’s face. “D’
you feel any better for makin’ me tell it?”</p>

<p>Certainly her revenge for the persecution was
all that heart could desire. Her mother sat limp
and motionless, save for the slow, mechanical
sliding back and forth of one thumb on the arm
of her chair.</p>

<p>After a while Zarelda resumed the hair-brushing,
calmly. Then her mother revived.</p>

<p>“Who—who in the name of all that’s merciful
has he took up with now?” she asked, weakly.</p>

<p>“Em Brackett.”</p>

<p>“What!” Mrs. Winser almost screamed.
“That onery hussy! ’Reldy Winser, be you
a-tellin’ me the truth?”</p>

<p>“Yes, maw. He took her to the dance up at
Canemah las’ night, an’ she told me about it this
mornin’!”</p>

<p>“The deceitful jade. Smiled sweet as honey
at me when she went by. You’d of thought
sugar wouldn’t melt in her mouth. I answered
her ’s short as lard pie-crust—I’m glad of it
now. Has he took her any place else?”</p>

<p>“He took her walkin’ at noontime. Stepped
right up when she was standin’ alongside o’ me
an’ never looked at me, an’ ast her—right out
loud so’s all of ’em could hear, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’d ought to be ashamed of hisself!
After bein’ your stiddy comp’ny for more’n a year—well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
onto two years—an’ a-lettin’ all of us
think he was serious!”</p>

<p>“He never said he was, maw.”</p>

<p>“He never said he was, aigh? ’Reldy Winser,
you ain’t got enough spunk to keep a chicken
alive, let alone a woman! ‘He never said he
was,’ aigh? Well, ain’t he been a-comin’ here
three nights a week nigh onto two year, an’
a-takin’ you every place, an’ never a-lookin’ at
any other girl? An’ didn’t he give you an
amyfist ring las’ Christmas, an’ a reel garnet pin
on your birthday? An’ didn’t he come here one
evenin’, a-laffin’ an’ a-actin’ up foolish in a great
way an’ holler out—‘Hello, maw Winser?’
Now, don’t you go a-tellin’ me he never meant
anything serious.”</p>

<p>“Well, he never said so,” said the girl, stubbornly.</p>

<p>“I don’t care if he <i>never</i> said so. He acted
so. Why, for pity’s sake! You’ve got a grease-spot
on your dress. I never see you with a
grease-spot before—you’re so tidy. How’d you
get it on?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Benzine’ll take it out. Well—I’m a-goin’
to give him a piece o’ my mind!”</p>

<p>Zarelda lifted her body suddenly. She looked
tall. Her eyes flamed out their proud fire.</p>

<p>“Now, see here, maw,” she said, “you don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
say a word to him—not a word. This ain’t
your affair; it’s mine. It’s the fashion in fact’ry
society for a girl an’ a fellow to go together, an’
give each other things, without bein’ real engaged;
an’ she has to take her chances o’ some
other girl gettin’ him away from her. If he
wants to throw off on her, all he’s got to do ’s to
take some other girl to a dance or out walkin’.
An’ then, if he’s give her a ring or anything, it’s
etiquette for her to send it back to him, an’ he’ll
most likely give it to the other girl. I don’t think
it’s right, an’ I don’t say but what it’s hard—”
her voice trembled and broke, but she conquered
her emotion stubbornly and went on—“but it’s
the way in fact’ry society. There ain’t a girl in
the fact’ry but what’s had to stand it some time
or other, an’ I guess I can. You don’t want me
to be a laffin’-stawk, do you?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t.” Her mother looked at her in
a kind of admiring despair. “But I never hear
tell of such fashions an’ such doin’s in all my
born days. It’s shameful. Your paw an’ me
’d set our minds on your a-marryin’ him an’ gettin’
a home o’ your own. It’s been a burden off
o’ our minds for a year past—”</p>

<p>“Oh, maw!”</p>

<p>“Just to feel that you’d be fixed so’s you could
take care o’ your little sisters in case we dropped
off. An’ there I’ve went an’ made up all them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
underclo’s!” She leaned her head upon her
hand and sat looking at the floor with a forlornly
reminiscent expression. “An’ put tattin’ on
three sets, an’ crochet lace on three, an’ serpentine
edgin’ on three. An’ inserting on all of ’em!
That ain’t the worst of it. I’ve <i>worked his initial
in button-hole stitch</i> on every blessed thing!”</p>

<p>“Oh, maw, you never did that, did you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did. An’ what’s more, I showed
’em all to old Miss Bradley, too.”</p>

<p>“You might just as well of showed ’em to the
whole town!” said poor Zarelda, bitterly.</p>

<p>“They looked so nice I had to show ’em to
somebody.”</p>

<p>“Sister,” piped a little voice at the foot of the
stairs, “Mis’ Riley’s boy’s come to find out how
soon you’re a-comin’ over to set up with the sick
baby.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’d clear forgot.” Zarelda braided her
hair rapidly. “Tell him I’ll be over ’n a few
minutes.”</p>

<p>“Now, see here, ’Reldy,” said her mother,
getting up and laying her hand affectionately on
the girl’s arm, “you ain’t a-goin’ to budge a
single step over there to-night. You just get to
bed an’ put an arnicky plaster on your forehead—”</p>

<p>Zarelda laughed in a kind of miserable mirth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, you can laff, but it’ll help lots. I’ll go
over an’ set up with that baby myself.”</p>

<p>“No, you won’t, maw.” She slipped the last
pin in her hair and set her hat firmly on the
glistening braids. “I said I’d set up with the
baby, an’ I will. I ain’t goin’ to shirk just because
I’m in trouble.”</p>

<p>She went out into the cool autumn twilight.
Her mother followed her and stood looking after
her with sympathetic eyes. At last she turned
and went slowly into the poor and gloomy house;
as she closed the door she put all her bitterness
and disappointment into one heavy sigh.</p>

<p>The roar of the Falls came loudly to Zarelda
as she walked along rapidly. The dog-fennel
was still in blossom, and its greenish snow was
drifted high on both sides of her path. Still
higher were billows of everlasting flowers, undulating
in the soft wind. The fallen leaves rustled
mournfully as she walked through them. Some
cows were feeding on the commons near by; she
heard their deep breathing on the grass before
they tore and crushed it with their strong teeth;
she smelled their warm, fragrant breaths.</p>

<p>She came to a narrow bridge under the cotton-woods
where she saw the Willamette, silver and
beautiful, moving slowly and noiselessly between
its emerald walls. The slender, yellow sickle of
the new moon quivered upon its bosom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span></p>

<p>Zarelda stood still. The noble beauty of the
night—all its tenderness, all its beating passion—shook
her to the soul. Her life stretched
out before her, hard and narrow as the little path
running through the dog-fennel—a life of toil
and duty, of clamor and unrest, of hurried breakfasts,
cold lunches and half-warm suppers, of
longing for knowledge that would never be
hers—the hard and bitter treadmill of the factory
life.</p>

<p>A sob came up into her dry throat, but it did
not reach her lips.</p>

<p>“I won’t!” she said, setting her teeth together
hard. “I hate people who whine after
what they can’t have, instead o’ makin’ the best
o’ what they’ve got.”</p>

<p>She lifted her head and went on. Her face was
beautiful; something sweeter than moonlight
shone upon it. She walked proudly and the dry
leaves whirled behind her.</p>

<h3>IN THE BITTER ROOT MOUNTAINS</h3>

<p>“Go slow, boys, for God’s sake! If we miss
this landing, we are lost. The rapids begin just
around that bend.”</p>

<p>Four men stood upon a rude raft, and with
roughly-made oars and long fir poles were trying
to guide it out of the current of the swollen Clearwater
River into a small sheltered inlet.</p>

<p>Both shores of the river rose abruptly to steep
and terrible mountains. Not far above was the
snow-line.</p>

<p>The men’s faces were white and haggard, their
eyes anxious, half desperate. Huddled upon a
stretcher at one end of the raft was a young man,
little more than a boy, whose pallid, emaciated
face was turned slightly to one side. His eyes
were closed; the long black lashes lay like
heavy shadows upon his cheeks. The weak
November sunshine, struggling over the fierce
mountains, shone through his thin nostrils,
turning them pink, and giving an unearthly
look to the face. A collie crouched close beside
him, shivering with fear, yet ever and anon
licking the cold hand lying outside the gray
blanket; occasionally he lifted his head and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
uttered a long, mournful howl. Each time the
four men shuddered and exchanged looks of despair,—so
humanly appealing was it, and so
deeply did it voice the terrible dread in their own
hearts.</p>

<p>It was now two months since they had left Seattle
on a hunting expedition in the Bitter Root
Mountains in Idaho. For six weeks they had
been lost in those awful snow fastnesses. Their
hunting dogs had been killed by wild beasts.
Their twelve pack-ponies had been left to starve
to death when, finding further progress on land
impossible on account of the snow, they constructed
a raft and started on their perilous journey down
the Clearwater.</p>

<p>The cook had been sick almost the entire time,
and their progress had been necessarily slow and
discouraging. They had now reached a point
where the river was so full of boulders and so
swift that they could proceed no farther on the
raft.</p>

<p>For several days the cook had been unconscious,
lying in a speechless stupor; but when they had,
with much danger and excitement, landed and
made him comfortable in a protected nook, he
suddenly spoke,—faintly but distinctly.</p>

<p>“Polly,” he said, with deep tenderness, “lay
your hand on my head. I guess it won’t ache so,
then.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span></p>

<p>The four men, looking at him, grew whiter.
They could not look at each other. The dog, having
already taken his place beside him, lifted his
head and looked at him with pitiable eagerness.</p>

<p>“Oh, Polly!”—there was a heart-break in the
voice,—“you don’t know what I’ve suffered!
The cold, and then the fever! The pain has been
awful. Oh, I’ve wanted you so, Polly—I’ve
wanted you so!... But it’s all right, now
that I’m home again.... Where’s the baby,
Polly? Oh, the nights that I’ve laid, freezing
and suffering in the snow, just kept alive by the
thought o’ you an’ the little man! I knew it
’u’d kill you ’f I died—so I <i>w’u’dn’t</i> give up! An’
now I’m here ’t home again. Polly——”</p>

<p>“We must fix some supper, boys,” said Darnell,
roughly, turning away to hide his emotion.
“Let’s get the fire started.”</p>

<p>“We’ve just got enough for one more good
meal,” said Roberts, in a tremulous voice.
“There’s no game around here, either. Guide,
you must try to find a way out of this before
dark, so we can start early in the morning.”</p>

<p>Without speaking, the guide obeyed. It was
dark when he returned. The men were sitting
by the camp-fire, eating their supper. The
dog still lay by his master, from whom even hunger
could not tempt him.</p>

<p>The three men looked at the guide. He sat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
down and took his cup of coffee in silence.
“Well,” said Darnell, at last, “can we go on?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the guide, slowly; “we can. In
some places there’ll be only a few inches’ foothold;
an’ we’ll hev to hang on to bushes up
above us, with the river in some places hundreds
o’ feet below; but we can do it, ’f we don’t get
rattled an’ lose our heads.”</p>

<p>There was a deep and significant silence. Then
Brotherton said, with white lips, “Do you mean
that we can’t take <i>him</i>?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I mean.” The guide spoke deliberately.
He could not lift his eyes. Some of
the coffee spilled as he lifted the cup to his lips.
“We can’t take a thing, ’cept our hands and
feet,—not even a blanket. It’ll be life an’ death
to do it, then.”</p>

<p>There was another silence. At last Darnell said:
“Then it is for us to decide whether we shall
leave him to die alone while we save ourselves,
or stay and die with him?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the guide.</p>

<p>“There is positively not the faintest chance of
getting him out with us?”</p>

<p>“By God, no!” burst forth the guide, passionately.
“It seems like puttin’ the responsibility
on me, but you want the truth, an’ that’s
it. He can’t be got out. It’s leave him an’ save
ourselves, or stay with him an’ starve.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span></p>

<p>After a long while Roberts said, in a low voice:
“He’s unconscious. He wouldn’t know we had
gone.”</p>

<p>“He cannot possibly live three days, under
any circumstances,” said Brotherton. “Mortification
has already begun in his legs.”</p>

<p>“Good God!” exclaimed Darnell, jumping up
and beginning to walk rapidly forth and back,
before the fire. “I must go home, boys! My
wife—when I think of her, I am afraid of losing
my reason! When I think what she is suffering——”</p>

<p>Brotherton looked at him. Then he sunk his
face into both his hands. He, too, had a wife. The
guide put down his coffee; large tears came into
his honest eyes. He had no wife, but there was
one——</p>

<p>Roberts got up suddenly. He had the look of
a tortured animal in his eyes. “Boys,” he said,
“my wife is dead. My life doesn’t matter so
much, but—I’ve three little girls! I <i>must</i> get
back, somehow!”</p>

<p>The sick man spoke. They all started guiltily,
and looked toward him. “Yes, yes, Polly,” he
said, soothingly, “I know how you worried about
me. I know how you set strainin’ your eyes out
the window day an’ night, watchin’ fer me. But
now I’m home again, an’ it’s all right. I guess
you prayed, Polly; an’ I guess God heard you....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
There’s a boy fer you! He knows me,
too.”</p>

<p>The silence that fell upon them was long and
terrible. The guide arose at last, and, without
speaking, made some broth from the last of the
canned beef, and forced it between the sick man’s
lips. When he came back to the fire, Darnell
took a silver dollar out of his pocket.</p>

<p>“Boys,” he said, brokenly, “I don’t want to
be the one to settle this, and I guess none of you
do. It is an awful thing to decide. I shall throw
this dollar high into the air. If it falls heads up,
we go; tails—we stay.”</p>

<p>The men had lifted their heads and were watching
him. They were all very white; they were all
trembling.</p>

<p>“Are you willing to decide it in this way?”</p>

<p>Each answered, “Yes.”</p>

<p>“I swear,” said Darnell, slowly and solemnly,
“that I will abide by this decision. Do you all
swear the same?”</p>

<p>Each, in turn, took the oath. Trembling now
perceptibly, Darnell lifted his hand slowly and
cast the piece of silver into the air. Their eyes
followed its shining course. For a second it disappeared;
then it came singing to the earth.</p>

<p>Like drunken men they staggered to the spot
where it had fallen, and fell upon their knees,
staring with straining eyes and bloodless lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span></p>

<p>“It is heads,” said Darnell. He wiped the
cold perspiration from his brow.</p>

<p>At that moment the dog lifted his head and
sent a long, mournful howl to die in faint echoes
in the mountains across the river.</p>

<p class="tb">At daylight they were ready to start. Snow
lay on the ground to a depth of six inches. But
a terrible surprise awaited them. At the last moment
they discovered that the cook was conscious.</p>

<p>“You’re not going—to leave me?” he said,
in a whisper. His eyes seemed to be leaping out
of their hollow sockets with terror.</p>

<p>“Only for a few hours,” said Brotherton, huskily.
“Only to find a way out of this,—to make
a path over which we can carry you.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” he said, faintly; “I thought—— but
you wouldn’t. In the name o’ God, don’t leave
me to die alone!”</p>

<p>They assured him that they would soon return.
Then, making him as comfortable as possible,
they went,—without hesitation, without one
backward look. There was no noise. The snow
fell softly and silently through the firs; the river
flowed swiftly through its wild banks. The sick
man lay with closed eyes, trustfully. But the
dog knew. For the first time he left his master.
He ran after them, and threw himself before them,
moaning. His lifted eyes had a soul in them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
He leaped before them, and upon them, licking
their hands and clothing; he cast himself prone
upon their feet, like one praying. No human
being ever entreated for his life so passionately,
so pathetically, as that dog pleaded for his master’s.</p>

<p>At last, half desperate as they were, they
kicked him savagely and flung him off. With a
look in his eyes that haunted them as long as
they lived, he retreated then to his master’s side,
and lay down in a heavy huddle of despair,
still watching them. As they disappeared, he
lifted his head, and for the last time they heard
that long, heart-breaking howl.</p>

<p>It was answered by a coyote in the canyon
above.</p>

<p class="tb">A week later the Associated Press sent out the
following dispatch:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Darnell party, who were supposed to have perished
in the Bitter Root Mountains, returned last night.
Their hardships and sufferings were terrible. There is
great rejoicing over their safe return. They were compelled
to leave the cook, who had been sick the entire
time, to die in the mountains. But for their determined
efforts to bring him out alive, they would certainly have
returned a month earlier.”</p>

</div>

<p>The world read the dispatch and rejoiced with
those rejoicing. But one woman, reading it,
fell, as one dead, beside her laughing boy.</p>

<h3>PATIENCE APPLEBY’S CONFESSING-UP</h3>

<p>“It must be goin’ to rain! My arm aches me
so I can hardly hold my knitting needles.”</p>

<p>“Hunh!” said Mrs. Wincoop. She twisted
her thread around her fingers two or three times
to make a knot; then she held her needle up to
the light and threaded it, closing one eye entirely
and the other partially, and pursing her mouth
until her chin was flattened and full of tiny
wrinkles. She lowered her head and looking at
Mrs. Willis over her spectacles with a kind of
good-natured scorn, said—“Is that a sign o’
rain?”</p>

<p>“It never fails.” Mrs. Willis rocked back and
forth comfortably. “Like as not it begins to
ache me a whole week before it rains.”</p>

<p>“I never hear tell o’ such a thing in all my
days,” said Mrs. Wincoop, with unmistakable
signs of firmness, as she bent over the canton
flannel night-shirt she was making for Mr. Wincoop.</p>

<p>“Well, mebbe you never. Mebbe you never
had the rheumatiz. I’ve had it twenty year.
I can’t get red of it, anyways. I’ve tried the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
Century liniment—the one that has the man
riding over snakes an’ things—and the arnicky,
and ev’ry kind the drug-store keeps. I’ve wore
salt in my shoes tell they turned white all over;
and I kep’ a buckeye in my pocket tell it wore a
hole and fell out. But I never get red o’ the
rheumatiz.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wincoop took two or three stitches in
silence; then she said—“Patience, now, she <i>can</i>
talk o’ having rheumatiz. She’s most bent in
two with it when she has it—and that’s near all
the time.”</p>

<p>The rocking ceased abruptly. Mrs. Willis’s
brows met, giving a look of sternness to her face.</p>

<p>“That’s a good piece o’ cotton flannel,” she
said. “Hefty! Fer pity’s sake! D’ you put
ruffles on the bottom o’ Mr. Wincoop’s night-shirt?
Whatever d’you do that fer?”</p>

<p>“Because he likes ’em that way,” responded
Mrs. Wincoop, tartly. “There’s no call fer remarks
as I see, Mis’ Willis. You put a pocket
’n Mr. Willis’s, and paw never’d have that—never!”
firmly.</p>

<p>“Well, I never see ruffles on a man’s night-shirt
before,” said Mrs. Willis, laughing rather
aggravatingly. “But they do look reel pretty,
anyways.”</p>

<p>“The longer you live the more you learn.”
Mrs. Wincoop spoke condescendingly. “But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
talking about Patience—have you see her lately?”</p>

<p>“No, I ain’t.” Mrs. Willis got up suddenly
and commenced rummaging about on the table;
there were two red spots on her thin face. “I’d
most fergot to show you my new winter underclo’s.
Ain’t them nice and warm, though?
They feel so good to my rheumatiz. I keep thinking
about them that can’t get any. My, such
hard times! All the banks broke, and no more
prospect of good times than of a hen’s being
hatched with teeth! It puts me all of a trimble
to think o’ the winter here and ev’rybody so hard
up. It’s a pretty pass we’ve come to.”</p>

<p>“I should say so. I don’t see what Patience
is a-going to live on this winter. She ain’t fit to
do anything; her rheumatiz is awful. She ain’t
got any fine wool underclo’s.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Willis sat down again, but she did not
rock; she sat upright, holding her back stiff and
her thin shoulders high and level.</p>

<p>“I guess this tight spell’ll learn folks to lay by
money when they got it,” she said, sternly. “I
notice we ain’t got any mortgage on our place,
and I notice we got five thousand dollars invested.
We got some cattle besides. We ain’t
frittered ev’rything we made away on foolishness,
like some that I know of. We have things good
and comf’terble, but we don’t put on any style.
Look at that Mis’ Abernathy! I caught her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
teeheeing behind my back when I was buying
red checked table clo’s. Her husband a bookkeeper!
And her a-putting on airs over me that
could buy her up any day in the week! Now,
he’s lost his place, and I reckon she’ll come down
a peg or two.”</p>

<p>“She’s been reel good to Patience, anyways,”
said Mrs. Wincoop.</p>

<p>Mrs. Willis knitted so fast her needles fairly
rasped together.</p>

<p>“She takes her in jell and perserves right
frequent. You mind Patience always liked sweet
things even when her ’n’ Lizy was girls together,
Eunice.”</p>

<p>It was so unusual for one of these two women
to speak the other’s name that they now exchanged
quick looks of surprise. Indeed, Mrs.
Wincoop seemed the more surprised of the two.
But the hard, matter-of-fact expression returned
at once to each face. If possible, Mrs. Willis
looked more grim and sour than before the unwonted
address had startled her out of her composure.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, scarcely unclosing her thin
lips, “I reckon she had all the sweet things she
was a-hankering after when she was a girl. I
reckon she had a plenty and to spare, and I expect
they got to tasting pretty bitter a good spell
ago. Too much sweet always leaves a bit’rish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
taste in the mouth. My religion is—do what’s
right, and don’t wink at them that does wrong.
I’ve stuck to my religion, I reckon you can’t
get anybody to stand up and put their finger on
anything wrong I’ve done—nor any of my fambly,
either.” Mrs. Wincoop put her hand on her
chest and coughed mournfully. “Let them that’s
<i>sinned</i>,” went on Mrs. Willis, lifting her pale,
cold eyes and setting them full on her visitor,
“make allowance fer sinners, say I. Mis’ Abernathy,
or Mis’ Anybody Else, can pack all the
clo’s and all the sweet things they’ve got a mind to
over to Patience Appleby; mebbe they’ve sinned,
too—<i>I</i> don’t know! But I do know that I
ain’t, and so I don’t pack things over to her, even
if she is all doubled up with the rheumatiz,” unconsciously
imitating Mrs. Wincoop’s tone. “And
I don’t make no allowance for her sins, either,
Mis’ Wincoop.”</p>

<p>A faint color came slowly, as if after careful
consideration, to Mrs. Wincoop’s face.</p>

<p>“There wa’n’t no call fer you a-telling that,”
she said, with a great calmness. “The whole
town knows you wouldn’t fergive a sin, if your
fergiving it ’u’d save the sinner hisself from being
lost! The whole town knows what your religion
is, Mis’ Willis. You set yourself up and call
yourself perfeck, and wrap yourself up in yourself—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span></p>

<p>“There come the men—sh!” said Mrs. Willis.
Her face relaxed, but with evident reluctance.
She began to knit industriously. But the temptation
to have the last word was strong.</p>

<p>“It ain’t my religion, either,” she said, her
voice losing none of its determination because
it was lowered. “I’d of fergive her if she’d a-confessed
up. We all tried to get her to. I tried
more ’n anybody. I told her”—in a tone of
conviction—“that nobody but a brazen thing
’u’d do what she’d done and not confess up to ’t—and
it never fazed her. She <i>wouldn’t</i> confess
up.”</p>

<p>The men were scraping their feet noisily now
on the porch, and Mrs. Willis leaned back with a
satisfied expression, expecting no reply. But
Mrs. Wincoop surprised her. She was sewing
the last pearl button on Mr. Wincoop’s night-shirt,
and as she drew the thread through and
fastened it with scrupulous care, she said, without
looking up—“I don’t take much stock in
confessings myself, Mis’ Willis. I don’t see just
how confessings is good for the soul when they
hurt so many innocent ones as well as the guilty
ones. Ev’ry confessing affex somebody else; and
so I say if you repent and want to atone you can
do ’t without confessing and bringing disgrace on
others. It’s nothing but curiosity that makes
people holler out—‘Confess-up now! Confess-up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
now.’ It ain’t anybody’s business but God’s—and
I reckon <i>He</i> knows when a body’s sorry
he’s sinned and wants to do better, and I reckon
He helps him just as much as if he got up on a
church tower and kep’ a-hollering out—‘Oh,
good grieve, I’ve sinned! I’ve sinned!’—so’s
the whole town could run and gap’ at him! Mis’
Willis, if some confessing-ups was done in this
town that I know of, some people ’u’d be affected
that ’u’d surprise you.” Then she lifted up her
voice cheerfully—“That you, father? Well, d’
you bring the lantern? I reckon we’d best go
right home; it’s getting latish, and Mis’ Willis
thinks, from the way her arm aches her, that it’s
going to rain.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Willis sat knitting long after Mr. Willis
had gone to bed. Her face was more stern even
than usual. She sat uncomfortably erect and did
not rock. When the clock told ten, she arose
stiffly and rolled the half finished stocking around
the ball of yarn, fastening it there with the needles.
Then she laid it on the table and stood looking at
it intently, without seeing it. “I wonder,” she
said, at last, drawing a deep breath, “what she
was a-driving at! I’d give a pretty to know.”</p>

<p class="tb">“Mother, where’s my Sund’y pulse-warmers
at?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span></p>

<p>“<i>I</i> don’t know where your Sund’y pulse-warmers
are at. Father, you’d aggravate a body into
her grave! You don’t half look up anything—and
then begin asking me where it’s at. What’s
under that bunch o’ collars in your drawer?
Looks some like your Sund’y pulse-warmers, don’t
it? This ain’t Sund’y, anyways. Wa’n’t your
ev’ryday ones good enough to wear just to a
church meeting?”</p>

<p>Mr. Willis had never been known to utter an
oath; but sometimes he looked as if his heart
were full of them.</p>

<p>“I reckon you don’t even know where your
han’ke’cher’s at, father.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do, mother. I guess you might stop
talking, an’ come on now—I’m all ready.”</p>

<p>He preceded his wife, leaving the front door
open for her to close and lock. He walked stiffly,
holding his head straight, lest his collar should
cramp his neck or prick his chin. He had a conscious,
dressed-up air. He carried in one hand a
lantern, in the other an umbrella. It was seven
o’clock of a Thursday evening and the bell was
ringing for prayer-meeting. There was to be a
church meeting afterward, at which the name of
Patience Appleby was to be brought up for membership.
Mrs. Willis breathed hard and deep as
she thought of it.</p>

<p>She walked behind her husband to receive the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
full light of the lantern, holding her skirts up
high above her gaiter-tops which were so large
and so worn as to elastic, that they fairly ruffled
around her spare, flat ankles. Her shadow danced
in piece-meal on the picket fence. After a while
she said—</p>

<p>“Father, I wish you wouldn’t keep swinging
that lantern so! A body can’t see where to put
their feet down. Who’s that ahead o’ us?”</p>

<p>“I can’t make out yet.”</p>

<p>“No wonder—you keep swinging that lantern
so! Father, what does <i>possess</i> you to be so aggravating?
If I’d of asked you to swing it, you
couldn’t of b’en <i>drug</i> to do it!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Willis was guiltless of personal vanity,
but she did realize the importance of her position
in village society, and something of this importance
was imparted to her carriage as she followed
Mr. Willis up the church aisle. She felt that
every eye was regarding her with respect, and
held her shoulders so high that her comfortable
shawl fell therefrom in fuller folds than usual.
She sat squarely in the pew, looking steadily and
unwinkingly at the wonderful red velvet cross
that hung over the spindle-legged pulpit, her
hands folded firmly in her lap. She had never
been able to understand how Sister Wirth who
sat in the pew in front of the Willises, could always
have her head a-lolling over to one side like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
a giddy, sixteen-year-old. Mrs. Willis abominated
such actions in a respectable, married
woman of family.</p>

<p>Mr. Willis crouched down uneasily in the corner
of the seat and sat motionless, with a self-conscious
blush across his weak eyes. His
umbrella, banded so loosely that it bulged like a
soiled-clothes bag, stood up against the back of
the next pew.</p>

<p>At the close of prayer-meeting no one stirred
from his seat. An ominous silence fell upon the
two dozen people assembled there. The clock
ticked loudly, and old lady Scranton, who suffered
of asthma, wheezed with every breath and whispered
to her neighbor that she was getting so
phthisicy she wished to mercy they’d hurry up or
she’d have to go home without voting. At last
one of the deacons arose and said with great
solemnity that he understood sister Wincoop had
a name to propose for membership.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Wincoop stood up she looked pale
but determined. Mrs. Willis would not turn to
look at her, but she caught every word spoken.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Wincoop, “I want to bring
up the name of Patience Appleby. I reckon you
all know Patience Appleby. She was born here,
and she’s always lived here. There’s them that
says she done wrong onct, but I guess she’s
about atoned up for that—if any mortal living<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
has. I’ve know her fifteen year, and I don’t
know any better behaving woman anywheres.
She never talks about anybody”—her eyes went
to Mrs. Willis’s rigid back—“and she never
complains. She’s alone and poor, and all crippled
up with the rheumatiz. She wants to join church
and live a Christian life, and I, fer one, am in favor
o’ us a-holding out our hand to her and helping
her up.”</p>

<p>“Amen!” shrilled out the minister on one of
his upper notes. There was a general rustle of
commendation—whispers back and forth, noddings
of heads, and many encouraging glances
directed toward sister Wincoop.</p>

<p>But of a sudden silence fell upon the small assembly.
Mrs. Willis had arisen. Her expression
was grim and uncompromising. At that moment
sister Shidler’s baby choked in its sleep, and cried
so loudly and so gaspingly that every one turned
to look at it.</p>

<p>In the momentary confusion Mr. Willis caught
hold of his wife’s dress and tried to pull her down;
but the unfortunate man only succeeded in ripping
a handful of gathers from the band. Mrs.
Willis looked down at him from her thin height.</p>

<p>“You let my gethers be,” she said, fiercely.
“You might of knew you’d tear ’em, a-taking
holt of ’em that way!”</p>

<p>Then quiet was restored and the wandering eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
came back to Mrs. Willis. “Brothers and sisters,”
she said, “it ain’t becoming in me to
remind you all what Mr. Willis and me have done
fer this church. It ain’t becoming in me to remind
you about the organ, and the new bell, and
the carpet fer the aisles—let alone our paying
twenty dollars more a year than any other member.
I say it ain’t becoming in me, and I never
’d mention it if it wa’n’t that I don’t feel like having
Patience Appleby in this church. If she does
come in, <i>I</i> go out.”</p>

<p>A tremor passed through the meeting. The
minister turned pale and stroked his meagre whiskers
nervously. He was a worthy man, and he
believed in saving souls. He had prayed and
plead with Patience to persuade her to unite with
the church, but he had not felt the faintest presentiment
that he was quarreling with his own
bread and butter in so doing. One soul scarcely
balances a consideration of that kind—especially
when a minister has six children and a wife with
a chronic disinclination to do anything but look
pretty and read papers at clubs and things. It
was small wonder that he turned pale.</p>

<p>“I want that you all should know just how I
feel about it,” continued Mrs. Willis. “I believe
in doing what’s right yourself and not excusing
them that does wrong. I don’t believe in having
people like Patience Appleby in this church; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
she don’t come in while <i>I’m</i> in, neither. That’s
all I got to say. I want that you all should understand
plain that her coming in means my going
out.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Willis sat down, well satisfied. She saw
that she had produced a profound sensation.
Every eye turned to the minister with a look that
said, plainly—“What have you to say to <i>that</i>?”</p>

<p>But the miserable man had not a word to say to
it. He sat helplessly stroking his whiskers, trying
to avoid the eyes of both Mrs. Wincoop and
Mrs. Willis. At last Deacon Berry said—“Why,
sister Willis, I think if a body repents and wants
to do better, the church ’ad ort to help ’em.
That’s what churches are for.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Willis cleared her throat.</p>

<p>“I don’t consider that a body’s repented, Deacon
Berry, tell he confesses-up. Patience Appleby’s
never done that to this day. When she does,
I’m willing to take her into this church.”</p>

<p>“Brothers and sisters,” said Mrs. Wincoop, in
a voice that held a kind of cautious triumph, “I
fergot to state that Patience Appleby reckoned
mebbe somebody ’u’d think she’d ort to confess
before she come into the church; and she wanted
I should ask the meeting to a’point Mis’ Willis a
committee o’ one fer her to confess up to. Patience
reckoned if she could satisfy Mis’ Willis,
ev’rybody else ’u’d be satisfied.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span></p>

<p>“Why—yes,” cried the minister, with cheerful
eagerness. “That’s all right—bless the
Lord!” he added, in that jaunty tone with which
so many ministers daily insult our God. “I know
Mrs. Willis and Patience will be able to smooth
over all difficulties. I think we may now adjourn.”</p>

<p>“Whatever did she do that fer?” said Mrs.
Willis, following the lantern homeward. “She’s
got something in her mind, <i>I</i> know, or she’d
never want me a’p’inted. Father, what made you
pull my gethers out? D’you think you could
make me set down when I’d once made up my
mind to stand up? You’d ought to know me
better by this time. This is my secon’-best dress,
and I’ve only wore it two winters—and now
look at all these gethers tore right out!”</p>

<p>“You hadn’t ought to get up and make a fool
o’ yourself, mother. You’d best leave Patience
Appleby be.”</p>

<p>“You’d ort to talk about anybody a-making a
fool o’ hisself! After you a-pulling my gethers
clean out o’ the band—right in meeting! You’d
ort to tell me I’d best leave Patience Appleby be!
I don’t mean to leave her be. I mean to let her
know she can’t ac’ scandalous, and then set herself
up as being as good’s church folks and Christians.
<i>I’ll</i> give her her come-uppings!”</p>

<p>For probably the first time in his married life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
Mr. Willis yielded to his feelings. “God-a’mighty,
mother,” he said; “sometimes you
don’t seem to have common sense! I reckon
you’d best leave Patience Appleby be, if you
know when you’re well off.” Then, frightened
at what he had said, he walked on, hurriedly,
swinging the lantern harder than ever.</p>

<p>Mrs. Willis walked behind him, dumb.</p>

<p class="tb">The day was cold and gray. Mrs. Willis
opened with difficulty the broken-down gate that
shut in Patience Appleby’s house. “And no
wonder,” she thought, “it swags down so!”</p>

<p>There was a foot of snow on the ground. The
path to the old, shabby house was trackless. Not
a soul had been there since the snow fell—and that
was two days ago! Mrs. Willis shivered under
her warm shawl.</p>

<p>Patience opened the door. Her slow, heavy
steps on the bare floor of the long hall affected
Mrs. Willis strangely.</p>

<p>Patience was very tall and thin. She stooped,
and her chest was sunken. She wore a dingy
gray dress, mended in many places. There was
a small, checked shawl folded in a “three-cornered”
way about her shoulders. She coughed
before she could greet her visitor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span></p>

<p>“How d’you do, Mis’ Willis,” she said, at last.
“Come in, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“How are you, Patience?” Mrs. Willis said,
and, to her own amazement, her voice did not
sound as stern as she had intended it should.</p>

<p>She had been practicing as she came along,
and this voice bore no resemblance whatever to
the one she had been having in her mind. Nor,
as she preceded Patience down the bare, draughty
hall to the sitting-room, did she bear herself with
that degree of frigid dignity which she had always
considered most fitting to her position, both
socially and morally.</p>

<p>Somehow, the evidences of poverty on every
side chilled her blood. The sitting-room was
worse, even, than the hall. A big, empty room
with a small fireplace in one corner, wherein a
few coals were turning gray; a threadbare carpet,
a couple of chairs, a little table with the
Bible on it, ragged wall-paper, and a shelf in one
corner filled with liniment bottles.</p>

<p>Mrs. Willis sat down in one of the rickety
chairs, and Patience, after stirring up the coals,
drew the other to the hearth.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid the room feels kind o’ coolish,” she
said. “I’ve got the last o’ the coal on.”</p>

<p>“D’you mean,” said Mrs. Willis—and again
her voice surprised her—“that you’re all out o’
coal?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span></p>

<p>“All out.” She drew the tiny shawl closer to
her throat with trembling, bony fingers. “But
Mis’ Abernathy said she’d send me a scuttleful
over to-day. I hate to take it from her, too; her
husband’s lost his position and they ain’t overly
well off. But sence my rheumatiz has been so
bad I can’t earn a thing.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Willis stared hard at the coals. For the
life of her she could think of nothing but her
own basement filled to the ceiling with coal.</p>

<p>“I reckon,” said Patience, “you’ve come to
hear my confessing-up?”</p>

<p>“Why—yes.” Mrs. Willis started guiltily.</p>

<p>“What’s the charges agen me, Mis’ Willis?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Willis’s eyelids fell heavily.</p>

<p>“Why, I reckon you know, Patience. You
done wrong onct when you was a girl, and I
don’t think we’d ort to take you into the church
tell you own up to it.”</p>

<p>There was a little silence. Then Patience
said, drawing her breath in heavily—“Mebbe I
did do wrong onct when I was a little girl—only
fourteen, say. But that’s thirty year ago, and
that’s a long time, Mis’ Willis. I don’t think I’d
ort to own up to it.”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> think you’d ort.”</p>

<p>“Mis’ Willis,”—Patience spoke solemnly.
“D’you think I’d ort to own up if it ’u’d affec’
somebody else thet ain’t never b’en talked about?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” said Mrs. Willis, firmly. “If
they deserve to be talked about, they’d <i>ort</i> to be
talked about.”</p>

<p>“Even if it was about the best folks in town?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Mrs. Willis thought of the minister.</p>

<p>“Even if it was about the best-off folks?
Folks that hold their head the highest, and give
most to churches and missionary; and thet ev’rybody
looks up to?”</p>

<p>“Ye-es,” said Mrs. Willis. That did not describe
the minister, certainly. She could not
have told you why her heart began to beat so
violently. Somehow, she had been surprised out
of the attitude she had meant to assume. Instead
of walking in boldly and haughtily, and giving
Patience her “come-uppings,” she was finding it
difficult to conquer a feeling of pity for the
enemy because she was so poor and so cold. She
must harden her heart.</p>

<p>“Even”—Patience lowered her eyes to the
worn carpet—“if it was folks thet had b’en
loudest condemin’ other folks’s sins, and that had
bragged high and low thet there wa’n’t no disgrace
in their fambly, and never had b’en none,
and who’d just be about killed by my confessing-up?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Willis, sternly. But she
paled to the lips.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” said Patience, slowly. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
think a body’d ort to have a chance if they want
to live better, without havin’ anybody a-pryin’
into their effairs exceptin’ God. But if you don’t
agree with me, I’m ready to confess-up all <i>I’ve</i>
done bad. I guess you recollect, Mis’ Willis,
thet your ’Lizy and me was just of an age, to a
day?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Willis’s lips moved, but the words stuck
in her throat.</p>

<p>“And how we ust to play together and stay
nights with each other. We <i>loved</i> each other,
Mis’ Willis. You ust to give us big slices o’
salt-risin’ bread, spread thick with cream and
sprinkled with brown sugar—I can just see you
now, a-goin’ out to the spring-house to get the
cream. And I can just taste it, too, when I get
good and hungry.”</p>

<p>“What’s all this got to do with your a-owning
up?” demanded Mrs. Willis, fiercely. “What’s
my ’Lizy got to do with your going away that
time? Where was you at, Patience Appleby?”</p>

<p>“I’m comin’ to that,” said Patience, calmly;
but a deep flush came upon her face. “I’ve attoned-up
fer that time, if any mortal bein’ ever
did, Mis’ Willis. I’ve had a hard life, but I’ve
never complained, because I thought the Lord
was a-punishin’ me. But I have suffered....
Thirty year, Mis’ Willis, of prayin’ to be fergive
fer one sin! But I ain’t ever see the day I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
confess-up to ’t—and I couldn’t now, except to
’Lizy’s mother.”</p>

<p>An awful trembling shook Mrs. Willis’s heart.
She looked at Patience with straining eyes. “Go
on,” she said, hoarsely.</p>

<p>“’Lizy and me was fourteen on the same day.
She was goin’ to Four Corners to visit her a’nt,
but I had to stay at home and work. I was
cryin’ about it when, all of a sudden, ’Lizy
says—“Patience, let’s up and have a good time
on our birthday!”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s,” I says, “but how?”</p>

<p>“I’ll start fer Four Corners and then you run
away, and I’ll meet you, and we’ll go to Springville
to the circus and learn to ride bareback”—</p>

<p>Mrs. Willis leaned forward in her chair. Her
face was very white; her thin hands were clenched
so hard the knuckles stood out half an inch.</p>

<p>“Patience Appleby,” she said, “you’re a
wicked, sinful liar! May the Lord A’mighty fergive
you—<i>I</i> won’t.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t askin’ you to take my word; you can
ask Mr. Willis hisself. He didn’t go to Springville
to buy him a horse, like he told you he did.
’Lizy and me had been at the circus two days
when she tuk sick, and I sent fer Mr. Willis unbeknownst
to anybody. He come and tuk her
home and fixed it all up with her a’nt at Four
Corners, and give out thet she’d been a-visitin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
there. But I had to sneak home alone and live
an outcast’s life ever sense, and see her set up
above me—just because Mr. Willis got down to
beg me on his knees never to tell she was with
me. And I never did tell a soul, Mis’ Willis, tell
last winter I was sick with a fever and told Mis’
Wincoop when I was out o’ my head. But she’s
never told anybody, either, and neither of us ever
will. Mr. Willis has helped me as much as he
could without your a-findin’ it out, but I know how
it feels to be hungry and cold, and I know how it
feels to see ’Lizy set up over me, and marry rich,
and have nice children; and ride by me ’n her
kerriage without so much as lookin’ at me—and
me a-chokin’ with the dust off o’ her kerriage
wheels. But I never complained none, and I ain’t
a-complainin’ now, Mis’ Willis; puttin ’Lizy
down wouldn’t help me any. But I do think it’s
hard if I can’t be let into the church.”</p>

<p>Her thin voice died away and there was silence.
Patience sat staring at the coals with the dullness
of despair on her face. Mrs. Willis’s spare frame
had suddenly taken on an old, pathetic stoop.
What her haughty soul had suffered during that
recital, for which she had been so totally unprepared,
Patience would never realize. The world
seemed to be slipping from under the old woman’s
trembling feet. She had been so strong in her
condemnation of sinners because she had felt so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
sure she should never have any trading with sin
herself. And lo! all these years her own daughter—her
one beloved child, dearer than life itself—had
been as guilty as this poor outcast from
whom she had always drawn her skirts aside, as
from a leper. Ay, her daughter had been the
guiltier of the two. She was not spared that bitterness,
even. Her harsh sense of justice forced
her to acknowledge, even in that first hour, that
this woman had borne herself nobly, while her
daughter had been a despicable coward.</p>

<p>It had been an erect, middle-aged woman who
had come to give Patience Appleby her “come-uppings;”
it was an old, broken-spirited one who
went stumbling home in the early, cold twilight
of the winter day. The fierce splendor of the
sunset had blazed itself out; the world was a
monotone in milky blue—save for one high line
of dull crimson clouds strung along the horizon.</p>

<p>A shower of snow-birds sunk in Mrs. Willis’s
path, but she did not see them. She went up the
path and entered her comfortable home; and she
fell down upon her stiff knees beside the first chair
she came to—and prayed as she had never prayed
before in all her hard and selfish life.</p>

<p class="tb">When Mr. Willis came home to supper he found
his wife setting the table as usual. He started
for the bedroom, but she stopped him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span></p>

<p>“We’re a-going to use the front bedroom after
this, father,” she said.</p>

<p>“Why, what are we going to do that fer,
mother?”</p>

<p>“I’m a-going to give our’n to Patience Appleby.”</p>

<p>“You’re a-going to—<i>what</i>, mother?”</p>

<p>“I’m a-going to give our’n to Patience Appleby,
I say. I’m a-going to bring her here to live, and
she’s got to have the warmest room in the house,
because her rheumatiz is worse ’n mine. I’m
a-going after her myself to-morrow in the kerriage.”
She turned and faced her husband sternly.
“She’s confessed-up ev’rything. I was dead set
she should, and she has. I know where she was
at that time, and I know who was with her. I
reckon I’d best be attoning up as well as Patience
Appleby; and I’m going to begin by making her
comf’terble and taking her into the church.”</p>

<p>“Why, mother,” said the old man, weakly.
His wife repressed him with one look.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t go to talking back, father,” she
said, sternly. “I reckon you kep’ it from me fer
the best, but it’s turrable hard on me now. You
get and wash yourself. I want that you should
hold this candle while I fry the apple-fritters.”</p>

<h3>THE MOTHER OF “PILLS”</h3>

<p>“Pills! Oh, Pills! You Pillsy!”</p>

<p>The girl turned from the door of the drug-store,
and looked back under bent brows at her mother,
who was wiping graduated glasses with a stained
towel, at the end of the prescription counter.</p>

<p>“I wish you wouldn’t call me that,” she said;
her tone was impatient but not disrespectful.</p>

<p>Her mother laughed. She was a big, good-natured
looking woman, with light-blue eyes and
sandy eyebrows and hair. She wore a black dress
that had a cheap, white cord-ruche at the neck.
There were spots down the front of her dress
where acids had been spilled and had taken out
the color.</p>

<p>“How particular we are gettin’,” she said,
turning the measuring glass round and round on
the towel which had been wadded into it. “You
didn’t use to mind if I called you ‘Pills,’ just for
fun.”</p>

<p>“Well, I mind now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span></p>

<p>The girl took a clean towel from a cupboard
and began to polish the show-cases, breathing upon
them now and then. She was a good-looking
girl. She had strong, handsome features, and
heavy brown hair, which she wore in a long braid
down her back. A deep red rose was tucked in
the girdle of her cotton gown and its head lolled
to and fro as she worked. Her hands were not
prettily shaped, but sensitive, and the ends of the
fingers were square.</p>

<p>“Well, Mariella, then,” said Mrs. Mansfield,
still looking amused; “I was goin’ to ask you if
you knew the Indians had all come in on their
way home from hop pickin’.”</p>

<p>Mariella straightened up and looked at her
mother.</p>

<p>“Have they, honest, ma?”</p>

<p>“Yes, they have; they’re all camped down on
the beach.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wonder where!”</p>

<p>“Why, the Nooksacks are clear down at the
coal-bunkers, an’ the Lummies close to Timberline’s
Row; an’ the Alaskas are all on the other
side of the viaduct.”</p>

<p>“Are they goin’ to have the canoe race?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess so. I guess it’ll be about sundown
to-night. There, you forgot to dust that
milk-shake. An’ you ain’t touched that shelf o’
patent medicines!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span></p>

<p>She set down the last graduate and hung the
damp towel on a nail. Then she came out into
the main part of the store and sat down comfortably
behind the counter.</p>

<p>Long before Mariella was born her father had
opened a drug-store in the tiny town of Sehome,
on Puget Sound. There was a coal mine under
the town. A tunnel led down into it, and the
men working among the black diamonds, with
their families, made up the town. But there was
some trouble, and the mine was abandoned and
flooded with salt water. The men went away,
and for many years Sehome was little more than
a name. A mail boat wheezed up from Seattle
once a week; and two or three storekeepers—Mr.
Mansfield among them—clung to the ragged
edge of hope and waited for the boom. Before it
came, Mr. Mansfield was bumped over the terrible
road to the graveyard and laid down among
the stones and ferns. Then Mrs. Mansfield “run”
the store. The question “Can you fill perscriptions?”
was often put to her fearfully by timid
customers, but she was equal to the occasion.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I can,” she would say, squaring
about and looking her questioner unwaveringly
in the eye. “I guess I’d ought to. I’ve
been in the store with my husband, that’s dead,
for twenty years. I’m not a regular, but I’m a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
practical—an’ that’s better than a regular any
day.”</p>

<p>“It’s not so much what you know in a drug-store
as what you <i>look</i> like you know,” she sometimes
confided to admiring friends.</p>

<p>It is true Mrs. Mansfield was often perplexed
over the peculiar curdled appearance of some
mixture—being as untaught in the mysterious
ways of emulsions as a babe—but such trifles
were dismissed with a philosophical sigh, and the
prescriptions were handed over the counter with
a complaisance that commanded confidence. The
doctor hinted, with extreme delicacy, at times,
that his emulsions did not turn out as smooth as
he had expected; or that it would be agreeable
to find some of his aqueous mixtures tinged with
cochineal; or that it was possible to make pills
in such a way that they would not—so to
speak—melt in the patient’s mouth before he
could swallow them. But Mrs. Mansfield invariably
laughed at him in a kind of motherly way,
and reminded him that he ought to be glad to
have even a “practical” in a place like Sehome.
And really this was so true that it was unanswerable.</p>

<p>So Mrs. Mansfield held the fort; and as her
medicines, although abominable to swallow, never
killed any one, she was looked upon with awe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
and respect by the villagers and the men in the
neighboring logging-camps.</p>

<p>Mariella was brought up in the drug-store.
She had the benefit of her mother’s experience,
and, besides that, she had studied the “dispensatory”—a
word, by the way, which Mrs. Mansfield
began with a capital letter because of the
many pitfalls from which it had rescued her.</p>

<p>“Mariella is such a good girl,” her mother
frequently declared; “she got a real good education
over at the Whatcom schools, an’ she’s such
a help in the drug-store. She does make a beautiful
pill.”</p>

<p>Indeed, the girl’s pill-making accomplishment
was so appreciated by Mrs. Mansfield that she
had nick-named her “Pills”—a name that had
been the cause of much mirth between them.</p>

<p>Mariella was now sixteen, and the long-deferred
“boom” was upon them. Mrs. Mansfield and
her daughter contemplated it from the store door
daily with increasing admiration. The wild clover
no longer velveted the middle of the street. New
buildings, with red, green or blue fronts and nondescript
backs, leaped up on every corner and in
between corners. The hammers and saws made
music sweeter than any brass band to Sehome
ears. Day and night the forests blazed backward
from the town. When there were no customers in
the store Mariella stood in the door, twisting the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
rope of the awning around her wrist, and watched
the flames leaping from limb to limb up the tall,
straight fir-trees. When Sehome hill was burning
at night, it was a magnificent spectacle; like
hundreds of torches dipped into a very hell of
fire and lifted to heaven by invisible hands—while
in the East the noble, white dome of Mount Baker
burst out of the darkness against the lurid sky.
The old steamer <i>Idaho</i> came down from Seattle
three times a week now. When she landed, Mrs.
Mansfield and Mariella, and such customers as
chanced to be in the store, hurried breathlessly
back to the little sitting-room, which overlooked
the bay, to count the passengers. The old colony
wharf, running a mile out across the tide-lands
to deep water, would be “fairly alive with ’em,”
Mrs. Mansfield declared daily, in an ecstasy of
anticipation of the good times their coming foretold.
She counted never less than a hundred and
fifty; and so many walked three and four abreast
that it was not possible to count all.</p>

<p>Really, that summer everything seemed to be
going Mrs. Mansfield’s way. Mariella was a
comfort to her mother and an attraction to the
store; business was excellent; her property was
worth five times more than it had ever been before;
and, besides—when her thoughts reached
this point Mrs. Mansfield smiled consciously and
blushed—there was Mr. Grover! Mr. Grover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
kept the dry-goods store next door. He had
come at the very beginning of the boom. He was
slim and dark and forty. Mrs. Mansfield was
forty and large and fair. Both were “well off.”
Mr. Grover was lonely and “dropped into” Mrs.
Mansfield’s little sitting-room every night. She
invited him to supper frequently, and he told her
that her fried chicken and “cream” potatoes
were better than anything he had eaten since his
mother died. Of late his intentions were not to
be misunderstood, and Mrs. Mansfield was already
putting by a cozy sum for a wedding outfit. Only
that morning she had looked at herself in the
glass more attentively than usual while combing
her hair. Some thought made her blush and
smile.</p>

<p>“You ought to be ashamed!” she said, shaking
her head at herself in the glass as at a gay,
young thing. “To be thinkin’ about gettin’
married! With a big girl like Pills too. One
good thing: He really seems to think as much
of Pills as you do yourself, Mrs. Mansfield.
That’s what makes me so—happy, I guess. I
believe it’s the first time I ever was real happy
before.” She sighed unconsciously as she glanced
back over her years of married life. “An’ I don’t
know what makes me so awful happy now. But
sometimes when I get up of a mornin’ I just feel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
as if I could go out on the hill an’ sing—foolish
as any of them larks holler’n’ for joy.</p>

<p>“Mariella,” she said, watching the duster in
the girl’s hands, “what made you flare up so
when I called you ‘Pills?’ You never done that
before, an’ I don’t see what ails you all of a sudden.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to flare up,” said Mariella.
She opened the cigar-case and arranged the boxes
carefully. Then she closed it with a snap and
looked at her mother. “But I wish you’d stop
it, ma. Mr. Grover said——”</p>

<p>“Well, what ’id he say?”</p>

<p>“He said it wasn’t a nice name to call a girl
by.” Mariella’s face reddened, but she was stooping
behind the counter.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mansfield drummed on the show-case with
broad fingers and looked thoughtful.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said with significance, after a
pause, “if he don’t like it, I won’t do it. We’ve
had lots o’ fun over it, Pills, ain’t we—I mean
Mariella—but I guess he has a right to say what
you’ll be called, Pi—— my dear.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ma,” said Mariella. Her face was like
a poppy.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you won’t object, will you?
I’ve been wond’rin’ how you felt about it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ma,” faltered the girl; “do you think,
honest, he—— he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” replied her mother, laughing comfortably
and blushing faintly. “I’m sure of it.
An’ I’m happier ’n I ever was in my life over it.
I don’t think I could give you a better stepfather,
or one that would think more of you.”</p>

<p>Mariella stood up slowly behind the counter
and looked—stared—across the room at her
mother, in a dazed, uncomprehending way. The
color ebbed slowly out of her face. She did not
speak, but she felt the muscles about her mouth
jerking. She pressed her lips more tightly together.</p>

<p>“I hope you don’t think I oughtn’t to marry
again,” said her mother, returning her look without
understanding it in the least. “Your pa’s
been dead ten years”—this in an injured tone.
“There ain’t many women—— Oh, good mornin’,
Mr. Lester? Mariella, ’ll you wait on Mr. Lester?
Well”—beaming good naturedly on her
customer—“how’s real estate this mornin’? Any
new sales afoot?”</p>

<p>“<i>Are</i> there?” repeated that gentleman, leaning
on the show-case and lighting his cigar, innocent
of intentional discourtesy. “Well, I should <i>smile</i>—and
smile broadly too, Mrs. Mansfield.
There’s a Minneapolis chap here that’s buyin’
right an’ left; just <i>slashin’</i> things! He’s bought
a lot o’ water-front property, too; an’ let me tell
<i>you</i>, right now, that Jim Hill’s behind him; an’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
Jim Hill’s the biggest railroad man in the U. S.
to-day, an’ the Great Northern’s behind <i>him</i>!”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope so.” Mrs. Mansfield drew
a long breath of delight. Mr. Lester smiled,
shrugged his shoulders, spread out his hands, and
sauntered out with the air of a man who has the
ear of railroad kings.</p>

<p>“Are you goin’ to the canoe races to-night,
Mariella?” began her mother, in a conciliatory
tone.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Might as well, I guess.”</p>

<p>The girl was wiping the shelf bottles now; her
face was pale, but her back was to her mother.</p>

<p>“Well, we will have an early supper, so you
can get off. Mercy, child! Did you break one
o’ them glass labels? How often ’v’ I told you
not to press on ’em so hard? What one is it?
The tincture cantharides! Well, tie a string
around it, so we’ll know what it is. There ain’t
no label on the aconite bottle, nor the Jamaica
ginger either—an’ them settin’ side by side, too.
I hate guessin’ at things in a drug-store—specially
when one’s a poison. Have you scoured up
them spatulas?”</p>

<p>“Yes’m.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll go in an’ do up the dishes, an’
leave you to ’tend store. Don’t forget to make
Mr. Benson’s pills.”</p>

<p>But Mr. Benson’s pills were not made right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
away. When her mother was gone, Mariella got
down from the step-ladder and leaned one elbow
on the show-case and rested her chin in her hand.
Her throat swelled in and out fitfully, and the
blue veins showed, large and full, on her temples.
For a long time she stood thus, twisting the towel
in her hand and looking at the fires on the hill
without seeing them. Some of their dry burning
seemed to get into her own eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. Grover, passing, glanced in.</p>

<p>“Mariella,” he said, putting one foot across
the threshold, “are you goin’ to the canoe
races?”</p>

<p>The girl had darted erect instantly, and put on
a look of coquettish indifference.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am.” Her eyes flashed at him over
her shoulder from the corners of their lids as she
started back to the prescription-case. “I’m goin’
with Charlie Walton!”</p>

<p>When Mariella had gone to the races that
night, and customers were few and far between,
Mr. Grover walked with a determined air through
Mrs. Mansfield’s store and, pushing aside the
crimson canton-flannel portieres, entered her
cheerful sitting-room. On the floor was a Brussels
carpet, large-flowered and vivid. A sewing-machine
stood in one corner and Mariella’s organ
in another. The two narrow windows overlooking
the sound were gay with blooming geraniums<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
and white curtains tied with red ribbons. There
was a trunk deceptively stuffed and cretonned
into the semblance of a settee; and there was a
wicker-chair that was full of rasping, aggravating
noises when you rocked in it. It had red ribbon
twisted through its back and arms. Mrs. Mansfield
was sitting in it now, reading a novel, and
the chair was complaining unceasingly.</p>

<p>Mr. Grover sat down on the trunk.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Mansfield,” he said, looking squarely at
her, “I’ve got somethin’ to ask of you, an’ I’m
goin’ to do it while Mariella’s away.”</p>

<p>“That so?” said Mrs. Mansfield.</p>

<p>The color in her cheek deepened almost to a
purple. She put one hand up to her face, and
with the other nervously wrinkled the corners of
the leaves of her novel. She lowered her lids
resolutely to hide the sudden joy in her eyes.</p>

<p>“I guess you know what I’ve been comin’
here so much for. I couldn’t help thinkin’, too,
that you liked the idea an’ was sort of encouragin’
me.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mansfield threw one hand out toward him
in a gesture at once deprecating, coquettish and
helpful.</p>

<p>“Oh, you!” she exclaimed, laughing and
coloring more deeply. There was decided encouragement
in her honest blue eyes under their
sandy lashes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span></p>

<p>“Well, didn’t you, now?” Mr. Grover leaned
toward her.</p>

<p>She hesitated, fingering the leaves of her book.
She turned her head to one side; the leaves
swished softly as they swept past her broad
thumb; the corners of her mouth curled in a tremulous
smile; the fingers of her other hand moved
in an unconscious caress across her warm cheek;
she remembered afterward that the band across
the bay on the long pier, where the races were,
was playing “Annie Laurie,” and that the odor
of wild musk, growing outside her window in a
box, was borne in, sweet and heavy, by the sea
winds. It was the one perfect moment of Mrs.
Mansfield’s life—in which there had been no
moments that even approached perfection; in
which there had been no hint of poetry—only
dullest, everyday prose. She had married because
she had been taught that women should
marry; and Mr. Mansfield had been a good husband.
She always said that; and she did not
even know that she always sighed after saying it.
Her regard for Mr. Grover was the poetry—the
wine—of her hard, frontier life. Never before
that summer had she stood and listened to the
message of the meadow-lark with a feeling of exaltation
that brought tears to her eyes; or gone
out to gather wild pink clover with the dew on
it; or turned her broad foot aside to spare a worm.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
Not that Mr. Grover ever did any of these things;
but that love had lifted the woman’s soul and
given her the new gift of seeing the beauty of
common things. No one had guessed that there
was a change in her heart, not even Mariella.</p>

<p>It was well that Mrs. Mansfield prolonged that
perfect moment. When she did lift her eyes there
was a kind of appealing tenderness in them.</p>

<p>“I guess I did,” she said.</p>

<p>“Well, then,”—Mr. Grover drew a breath of
relief—“you might’s well say I can have her. I
want it all understood before she gets home. I
want to stop her runnin’ with that Walton. Once
or twice I’ve been afraid you’d just as leave she’d
marry him as me. I don’t like to see girls gallivant
with two or three fellows.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mansfield sat motionless, looking at him.
Her eyes did not falter; the smile did not wholly
vanish from her face. Only the blood throbbed
slowly away, leaving it paler than Mariella’s had
been that morning. She understood her mistake
almost before his first sentence. While he was
speaking her thoughts were busy. She felt the
blood coming back when she remembered what
she had said to Mariella. If <i>only</i> she had not
spoken!</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, calmly, “have you said anything
to Mariella?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have; lots o’ times. An’ I know she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
likes me; but she’s some flirtish, and that’s what
I want to put a stop to. So, with your permission,
I’ll have a talk with her to-night.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to talk to her first myself.” Mrs.
Mansfield looked almost stern. “But I guess
it’ll be all right, Mr. Grover. If you’d just as
soon wait till to-morrow, I’d like to be alone and
make up my mind what to say to her.”</p>

<p>Mr. Grover got up and shook hands with her
awkwardly.</p>

<p>“I’ll make her a good husband,” he said, earnestly.</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt that,” replied Mrs. Mansfield.</p>

<p>Then he went out and the crimson curtain fell
behind him.</p>

<p class="tb">When Mariella came home her mother was sitting,
rocking, by the window. The lamp was
lighted.</p>

<p>“Pills,” she said, “I want you to stop goin’
with that fello’.”</p>

<p>The girl looked at her in silence. Then she
took off her turban and stuck the long black pins
back into it.</p>

<p>“I thought you liked him,” she said, slowly.</p>

<p>“I do, but Mr. Grover wants you—an’ I like
him better.”</p>

<p>“Wants <i>me</i>!” Mariella drew up her shoulders
proudly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, you,” replied Mrs. Mansfield, laughing.
The humor of the situation was beginning to appeal
to her. “He says he’d told you. You must
of laughed after I told you he wanted me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ma, does he want me, honest?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he does.” She was still laughing.</p>

<p>“An’ don’t you mind, ma?”</p>

<p>“Not a mite,” said the widow, cheerfully.
“I’d rather he’d marry you than me; only, I
thought he was too nice a man to be lost to the
fam’ly.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ma!”</p>

<p>“Well, get to bed now. He’s comin’ in the
mornin’ to see you.”</p>

<p>She took up the lamp and stood holding it irresolutely.</p>

<p>“Pills,” she said, looking embarrassed, “You
won’t ever tell him that I—— that I——”</p>

<p>“Never, ma!” exclaimed the girl, earnestly;
“as long as I live.”</p>

<p>“All right, then. Look out! You’re droppin’
tallo’ from your candle! Don’t hold it so crooked,
child! I wouldn’t like him to laugh about it.
Good-night.”</p>

<p>As she passed through the kitchen she called
out: “Oh, Pills! Mr. Jordan brought in a
mess of trout. We’ll have ’em fried for breakfast.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span></p>

<p>The girl came running after her mother, and
threw her arms around her.</p>

<p>“Oh, ma, are you sure you don’t care a bit?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” said Mrs. Mansfield, kissing her
heartily. “I just thought he ought to be in the
family. I’m glad it’s turned out this way. Now,
you go to bed, an’ don’t forget to roll up your
bangs.”</p>

<p>She went into her room and shut the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span></p>

<h3>MRS. RISLEY’S CHRISTMAS DINNER</h3>

<p>She was an old, old woman. She was crippled
with rheumatism and bent with toil. Her hair
was gray,—not that lovely white that softens
and beautifies the face, but harsh, grizzled gray.
Her shoulders were round, her chest was sunken,
her face had many deep wrinkles. Her feet were
large and knotty; her hands were large, too, with
great hollows running down their backs. And
how painfully the cords stood out in her old,
withered neck!</p>

<p>For the twentieth time she limped to the window
and flattened her face against the pane. It was
Christmas day. A violet sky sparkled coldly
over the frozen village. The ground was covered
with snow; the roofs were white with it. The
chimneys looked redder than usual as they
emerged from its pure drifts and sent slender
curls of electric-blue smoke into the air.</p>

<p>The wind was rising. Now and then it came
sweeping down the hill, pushing a great sheet of
snow, powdered like dust, before it. The window-sashes
did not fit tightly, and some of it
sifted into the room and climbed into little cones
on the floor. Snow-birds drifted past, like soft,
dark shadows; and high overhead wild geese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
went sculling through the yellow air, their mournful
“hawnk-e-hawnk-hawnks” sinking downward
like human cries.</p>

<p>As the old woman stood with her face against
the window and her weak eyes strained down the
street, a neighbor came to the door.</p>

<p>“Has your daughter an’ her fambly come yet,
Mis’ Risley?” she asked, entering sociably.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” replied Mrs. Risley, with a good
attempt at cheerfulness; but her knees suddenly
began shaking, and she sat down.</p>

<p>“Why, she’d ought to ’a’ come on the last
train, hadn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I do’ know. There’s a plenty o’ time.
Dinner won’t be ready tell two past.”</p>

<p>“She ain’t b’en to see you fer five year, has
she?” said the neighbor. “I reckon you’ll have
a right scrumptious set-out fer ’em?”</p>

<p>“I will so,” said Mrs. Risley, ignoring the
other question. “Her husband’s comin’.”</p>

<p>“I want to know! Why, he just thinks he’s
some punkins, I hear.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s rich enough to think hisself anything
he wants to,” Mrs. Risley’s voice took on
a tone of pride.</p>

<p>“I sh’u’d think you’d want to go an’ live with
’em. It’s offul hard fer you to live here all alone,
with your rheumatiz.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Risley stooped to lay a stick of wood on
the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve worked nigh onto two weeks over this
dinner,” she said, “a-seed’n’ raisins an’ cur’nts,
an’ things. I’ve hed to skimp harrable, Mis’
Tomlinson, to get it; but it’s just—<i>perfec’</i>.
Roast goose an’ cranberry sass, an’ cel’ry soup,
an’ mince an’ punkin pie,—to say nothin’ o’
plum-puddin’! An’ cookies an’ cur’nt-jell tarts
fer the children. I’ll hev to wear my old underclo’s
all winter to pay fer ’t; but I don’t care.”</p>

<p>“I sh’u’d think your daughter’d keep you
more comf’terble, seein’ her husband’s so rich.”</p>

<p>There was a silence. Mrs. Risley’s face grew
stern. The gold-colored cat came and arched her
back for a caress. “My bread riz beautiful,”
Mrs. Risley said then. “I worried so over ’t.
An’ my fruit-cake smells that good when I open
the stun crock! I put a hull cup o’ brandy in it.
Well, I guess you’ll hev to excuse me. I’ve got
to set the table.”</p>

<p>When Mrs. Tomlinson was gone, the strained
look came back to the old woman’s eyes. She
went on setting the table, but at the sound of a
wheel, or a step even, she began to tremble and
put her hand behind her ear to listen.</p>

<p>“It’s funny they <i>didn’t</i> come on that last train,”
she said. “I w’u’dn’t tell her, though. But
they’d ort to be here by this time.”</p>

<p>She opened the oven door. The hot, delicious
odor of its precious contents gushed out. Did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
ever goose brown so perfectly before? And how
large the liver was! It lay in the gravy in one
corner of the big dripping-pan, just beginning to
curl at the edges. She tested it carefully with a
little three-tined iron fork.</p>

<p>The mince-pie was on the table, waiting to be
warmed, and the pumpkin-pie was out on the
back porch,—from which the cat had been excluded
for the present. The cranberry sauce,
the celery in its high, old-fashioned glass, the little
bee-hive of hard sauce for the pudding and
the thick cream for the coffee, bore the pumpkin-pie
company. The currant jelly in the tarts
glowed like great red rubies set in circles of old
gold; the mashed potatoes were light and white as
foam.</p>

<p>For one moment, as she stood there in the savory
kitchen, she thought of the thin, worn flannels,
and how much better her rheumatism would
be with the warm ones which could have been
bought with the money spent for this dinner.
Then she flushed with self-shame.</p>

<p>“I must be gittin’ childish,” she exclaimed,
indignantly; “to begredge a Chris’mas dinner to
’Lizy. ’S if I hedn’t put up with old underclo’s
afore now! But I will say there ain’t many
women o’ my age thet c’u’d git up a dinner like
this ’n’,—rheumatiz an’ all.”</p>

<p>A long, shrill whistle announced the last train<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
from the city. Mrs. Risley started and turned
pale. A violent trembling seized her. She could
scarcely get to the window, she stumbled so. On
the way she stopped at the old walnut bureau to
put a lace cap on her white hair and to look anxiously
into the mirror.</p>

<p>“Five year!” she whispered. “It’s an offul
spell to go without seein’ your only daughter!
Everything’ll seem mighty poor an’ shabby to her,
I reckon,—her old mother worst o’ all. I never
sensed how I’d changed tell now. My! how no-account
I’m a gittin’! I’m all of a trimble!”</p>

<p>Then she stumbled on to the window and
pressed her cheek against the pane.</p>

<p>“They’d ort to be in sight now,” she said.
But the minutes went by, and they did not come.</p>

<p>“Mebbe they’ve stopped to talk, meetin’ folks,”
site said, again. “But they’d ort to be in sight
now.” She trembled so she had to get a chair
and sit down. But still she wrinkled her cheek
upon the cold pane and strained her dim eyes
down the street.</p>

<p>After a while a boy came whistling down from
the corner. There was a letter in his hand. He
stopped and rapped, and when she opened the
door with a kind of frightened haste, he gave her
the letter and went away, whistling again.</p>

<p>A letter! Why should a letter come? Her
heart was beating in her throat now,—that poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
old heart that had beaten under so many sorrows!
She searched in a dazed way for her glasses.
Then she fell helplessly into a chair and read it:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Mother</span>,—I am so sorry we cannot come,
after all. We just got word that Robert’s aunt has been
expecting us all the time, because we’ve spent every
Christmas there. We feel as if we <i>must</i> go there, because
she always goes to so much trouble to get up a fine
dinner; and we knew you wouldn’t do that. Besides,
she is so rich; and one has to think of one’s children,
you know. We’ll come, <i>sure</i>, next year. With a merry,
merry Christmas from all,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Eliza</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>It was hard work reading it, she had to spell out
so many of the words. After she had finished, she
sat for a long, long time motionless, looking at
the letter. Finally the cat came and rubbed
against her, “myowing” for her dinner. Then
she saw that the fire had burned down to a gray,
desolate ash.</p>

<p>She no longer trembled, although the room was
cold. The wind was blowing steadily now. It
was snowing, too. The bleak Christmas afternoon
and the long Christmas night stretched before
her. Her eyes rested upon the little fir-tree
on a table in one corner, with its gilt balls and
strings of popcorn and colored candles. She
could not bear the sight of it. She got up stiffly.</p>

<p>“Well, kitten,” she said, trying to speak
cheerfully, but with a pitiful break in her voice,
“let’s go out an’ eat our Christmas dinner.”</p>

electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
